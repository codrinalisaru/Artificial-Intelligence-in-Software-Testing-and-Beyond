AB The study introduces a new method for predicting software defects based on Residual/Shuffle (RS) Networks and an enhanced version of Fish Migration Optimization (UFMO). The overall contribution is to improve the accuracy, and reduce the manual effort needed. The originality of this work rests in the synergic use of deep learning and metaheuristics to train the software code for extraction of semantic and structural properties. The model is tested on a variety of open-source projects, yielding an average accuracy of 93% and surpassing the performance of the state-of-the-art models. The results indicate an overall increase in the precision (78-98%), recall (71-98%), F-measure (72-96%), and Area Under the Curve (AUC) (78-99%). The proposed model is simple and efficient and proves to be effective in identifying potential defects, consequently decreasing the chance of missing these defects and improving the overall quality of the software as opposed to existing approaches. However, the analysis is limited to open-source projects and warrants further evaluation on proprietary software. The study enables a robust and efficient tool for developers. This approach can revolutionize software development practices in order to use artificial intelligence to solve difficult issues presented in software. The model offers high accuracy to reduce the software development cost, which can improve user satisfaction, and enhance the overall quality of software being developed.

ID FEATURE-SELECTION
AB The development of reliable software depends heavily on the effective collaboration between teams responsible for development and testing. Despite ongoing efforts, many software programs still contain bugs that can lead to financial losses and business risks. Therefore, detecting and fixing software defects after release is crucial. While binary classification methods have been commonly used for this purpose, recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) advancements offer new opportunities for software teams to create more robust software. To address challenges in Software Defect Prediction (SDP), we conducted a thorough bibliographic survey of 79 research articles from the year 2011 to 2023 that examined previous models, datasets, data validation techniques, defect detection, prediction methods, and SDP tools. The survey revealed that previous research often lacked appropriate datasets with the necessary characteristics and data validation methods. Additionally, many standard datasets suffer from a lack of labels, which hinders effective defect detection. Systematic literature reviews on SDP are scarce, further emphasizing the importance of this study. Based on the findings, we provide crucial recommendations for designing effective SDP models and tools. The proposed survey outlines an architecture for constructing SDP datasets with the appropriate characteristics, as well as multi-label classification and data validation methodologies for software defects. This approach aims to enhance SDP research and contribute to the development of high-quality software products by improving defect prediction accuracy.

   synthetic knowledge synthesis
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed an exponential increase in use in various applications. Recently, the academic community started to research and inject new AI-based approaches to provide solutions to traditional software-engineering problems. However, a comprehensive and holistic understanding of the current status needs to be included. To close the above gap, synthetic knowledge synthesis was used to induce the research landscape of the contemporary research literature on the use of AI in software engineering. The synthesis resulted in 15 research categories and 5 themes-namely, natural language processing in software engineering, use of artificial intelligence in the management of the software development life cycle, use of machine learning in fault/defect prediction and effort estimation, employment of deep learning in intelligent software engineering and code management, and mining software repositories to improve software quality. The most productive country was China (n = 2042), followed by the United States (n = 1193), India (n = 934), Germany (n = 445), and Canada (n = 381). A high percentage (n = 47.4%) of papers were funded, showing the strong interest in this research topic. The convergence of AI and software engineering can significantly reduce the required resources, improve the quality, enhance the user experience, and improve the well-being of software developers.

AB The advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence is opening essential questions about whether and when AI will replace human abilities in accomplishing everyday tasks. This issue is particularly true in the domain of software development, where generative AI seems to have strong skills in solving coding problems and generating software source code. In this paper, an empirical evaluation of AI-generated source code is performed: three complex coding problems (selected from the exams for the Java Programming course at the University of Insubria) are prompted to three different Large Language Model (LLM) Engines, and the generated code is evaluated in its correctness and quality by means of human-implemented test suites and quality metrics. The experimentation shows that the three evaluated LLM engines are able to solve the three exams but with the constant supervision of software experts in performing these tasks. Currently, LLM engines need human-expert support to produce running code that is of good quality.

AB Context: Artificial intelligence (AI) methods and models have extensively been applied to support different phases of the software development lifecycle, including software testing (ST). Several secondary studies investigated the interplay between AI and ST but restricted the scope of the research to specific domains or sub-domains within either area.
   Objective: This research aims to explore the overall contribution of AI to ST, while identifying the most popular applications and potential paths for future research directions.
   Method: We executed a tertiary study following well-established guidelines for conducting systematic literature mappings in software engineering and for answering nine research questions. Results: We identified and analyzed 20 relevant secondary studies. The analysis was performed by drawing from well-recognized AI and ST taxonomies and mapping the selected studies according to them. The resulting mapping and discussions provide extensive and detailed information on the interplay between AI and ST.
   Conclusion: The application of AI to support ST is a well-consolidated and growing interest research topic. The mapping resulting from our study can be used by researchers to identify opportunities for future research, and by practitioners looking for evidence-based information on which AI-supported technology to possibly adopt in their testing processes.

AB The synergy between software engineering (SE) and artificial intelligence (AI) catalyzes software development, as numerous recent studies illustrate an intensified intersection between these domains. This systematic literature review examines the integration of AI techniques or methodologies across SE phases and related activities spanning from 2013 to 2023, resulting in the selection of 110 research papers. Investigating the profound influence of AI techniques, including machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, optimization algorithms, and expert systems, across various SE phases-such as planning, requirement engineering, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance-is the focal point of this study. Notably, the extensive adoption of machine learning and deep learning algorithms in the development and testing phases has enhanced software quality through defect prediction, code recommendation, and vulnerability detection initiatives. Furthermore, natural language processing's role in automating requirements classification and sentiment analysis has streamlined SE practices. Optimization algorithms have also demonstrated efficacy in refining SE activities such as feature location and software repair action predictions, augmenting precision and efficiency in maintenance endeavors. Prospective research emphasizes the imperative of interpretable AI models and the exploration of novel AI paradigms, including explainable AI and reinforcement learning, to promote ethical and efficient software development practices. This paper fills the gap identified in AI techniques dedicated to improving SE phases. The review concludes that AI in SE is revolutionizing the discipline, enhancing software quality, efficiency, and innovation, with ongoing efforts targeting the mitigation of identified limitations and the augmentation of AI capabilities for intelligent and dependable SE.

AB The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized various domains of artificial intelligence, including the realm of software engineering. In this research, we evaluate the efficacy of pre-trained LLMs in replicating the tasks traditionally performed by developers in response to code review comments. We provide code contexts to five popular LLMs and obtain the suggested code-changes (patch sets) derived from real-world code-review comments. The performance of each model is meticulously assessed by comparing their generated patch sets against the historical data of human-generated patch-sets from the same repositories. This comparative analysis aims to determine the accuracy, relevance, and depth of the LLMs' feedback, thereby evaluating their readiness to support developers in responding to code-review comments. Novelty: This particular research area is still immature requiring a substantial amount of studies yet to be done. No prior research has compared the performance of existing Large Language Models (LLMs) in code-review comments. This in-progress study assesses current LLMs in code review and paves the way for future advancements in automated code quality assurance, reducing context-switching overhead due to interruptions from code change requests.

AB Context: Software testing is applied to validate the behavior of the software system and identify flaws and bugs. Different machine learning technique types such as supervised and unsupervised learning were utilized in software testing. However, for some complex software testing scenarios, neither supervised nor unsupervised machine learning techniques were adequate. As such, researchers applied Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques in some cases. However, a systematic overview of the state-of-the-art on the role of reinforcement learning in software testing is lacking.Objective: The objective of this study is to determine how and to what extent RL was used in software testing.Methods: In this study, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted on the use of RL in software testing, and 40 primary studies were investigated.Results: This study highlights different software testing types to which RL has been applied, commonly used RL algorithms and architecture for learning, challenges faced, advantages and disadvantages of using RL, and the performance comparison of RL-based models against other techniques.Conclusions: RL has been widely used in software testing but has almost narrowed to two applications. There is a shortage of papers using advanced RL techniques in addition to multi-agent RL. Several challenges were presented in this study.

AB It gets harder and harder to guarantee the quality of software systems due to their increasing complexity and fast development. Because it helps spot errors and gaps during the first phases of software development, software testing is one of the most crucial stages of software engineering. Software testing used to be done manually, which is a time-consuming, imprecise procedure that comes with errors and gaps and costs money, time, and effort. Currently, testing professionals routinely automate testing to obtain trustworthy results while saving time, cost, and labor. We've also moved the starting point of the software cycle to the developer, and made write tests before even writing code, or what's known as TDD (Test Driven Development). The use of new artificial intelligence techniques will enable the generation of smart test cases to improve test quality and provide better coverage and accurate results. In this study, we used the Web of Science database to acquire bibliometric data about intelligent software testing papers which were conducted between 2012 and 2022, and we used Biblioshiny from the R bibliomerix package, alongside with VOSViewer in order to analyze the data and extract insights and answer research questions about the authors, articles, journals, organizations, and countries publishing in the field of intelligent software testing. The focus of this study is on scientific progress and collaborative trends in scholarly research, providing a blueprint for showcasing worldwide developments in the realm of intelligent software testing. By gaining a comprehensive understanding of the present state of research on the application of artificial intelligence in software testing, this study can offer valuable insights to software engineers, architects, and researchers in the field.

AB The recent popularity of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) corresponds with an increase in the risk of cyber-attacks. These cyber-attacks are instigated by white-coat hackers, and cyber-criminals. As Connected Vehicles move towards full autonomy the impact of these cyber-attacks also grows. The current research highlights challenges faced in cybersecurity testing of CAV, including access, the cost of representative test setup and the lack of experts in the field. Possible solutions of how these challenges can be overcome are reviewed and discussed. From these findings a software simulated Vehicular Ad Hoc NETwork (VANET) is established as a costeffective representative testbed. Penetration tests are then performed on this simulation, demonstrating a cyberattack in CAV. Studies have shown Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve runtime, increase efficiency and comprehensively cover all the typical test aspects, in penetration testing in other industries. In this research a Reinforcement Learning model, called Q-Learning, is applied to automate the software simulation. The expectation from this implementation is to see improvements in runtime and efficiency for the VANET model. The results show this approach to be promising and using AI in penetration testing for VANET to improve efficiency in most cases. Each case is reviewed in detail before discussing possible ways to improve the implementation and get a truer reflection of the real-world application.

AB Improving software quality by proactively detecting potential defects during development is a major goal of software engineering. Software defect prediction plays a central role in achieving this goal. The power of data analytics and machine learning allows us to focus our efforts where they are needed most. A key factor in the success of software fault prediction is selecting relevant features and reducing data dimensionality. Feature selection methods contribute by filtering out the most critical attributes from a plethora of potential features. These methods have the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of fault prediction models. However, the field of feature selection in the context of software fault prediction is vast and constantly evolving, with a variety of techniques and tools available. Based on these considerations, our systematic literature review conducts a comprehensive investigation of feature selection methods used in the context of software fault prediction. The research uses a refined search strategy involving four reputable digital libraries, including IEEE Explore, Science Direct, ACM Digital Library, and Springer Link, to provide a comprehensive and exhaustive review through a rigorous analysis of 49 selected primary studies from 2014. The results highlight several important issues. First, there is a prevalence of filtering and hybrid feature selection methods. Second, single classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree, as well as ensemble classifiers such as Random Forest, Bagging, and AdaBoost are commonly used. Third, evaluation metrics such as area under the curve, accuracy, and F-measure are commonly used for performance evaluation. Finally, there is a clear preference for tools such as WEKA, MATLAB, and Python. By providing insights into current trends and practices in the field, this study offers valuable guidance to researchers and practitioners to make informed decisions to improve software fault prediction models and contribute to the overall improvement of software quality.

AB Test case prioritisation (TCP) is a critical task in regression testing to ensure quality as software evolves. Machine learning has become a common way to achieve it. In particular, learning-to-rank (LTR) algorithms provide an effective method of ordering and prioritising test cases. However, their use poses a challenge in terms of explainability, both globally at the model level and locally for particular results. Here, we present and discuss scenarios that require different explanations and how the particularities of TCP (multiple builds over time, test case and test suite variations, etc.) could influence them. We include a preliminary experiment to analyse the similarity of explanations, showing that they do not only vary depending on test case-specific predictions, but also on the relative ranks.

AB Software Quality Assurance (SQA) planning aims to define proactive plans, such as defining maximum file size, to prevent the occurrence of software defects in future releases. To aid this, defect prediction models have been proposed to generate insights as the most important factors that are associated with software quality. Such insights that are derived from traditional defect models are far from actionable-i.e., practitioners still do not know what they should do or avoid to decrease the risk of having defects, and what is the risk threshold for each metric. A lack of actionable guidance and risk threshold can lead to inefficient and ineffective SQA planning processes. In this paper, we investigate the practitioners' perceptions of current SQA planning activities, current challenges of such SQA planning activities, and propose four types of guidance to support SQA planning. We then propose and evaluate our AI-Driven SQAPlanner approach, a novel approach for generating four types of guidance and their associated risk thresholds in the form of rule-based explanations for the predictions of defect prediction models. Finally, we develop and evaluate a visualization for our SQAPlanner approach. Through the use of qualitative survey and empirical evaluation, our results lead us to conclude that SQAPlanner is needed, effective, stable, and practically applicable. We also find that 80 percent of our survey respondents perceived that our visualization is more actionable. Thus, our SQAPlanner paves a way for novel research in actionable software analytics-i.e., generating actionable guidance on what should practitioners do and not do to decrease the risk of having defects to support SQA planning.

As mobile applications are becoming more prevalent in recent times, the need to have mobile applications that satisfy software quality through testing cannot be overemphasized. Testing suites and software quality assurance techniques have also become prevalent, which underscores the need to evaluate the efficacy of these tools in the testing of the applications. Mutation testing is one such technique, which is the process of injecting small changes into the software under test (SUT), thereby creating mutants. These mutants are then tested using mutation testing techniques alongside the SUT to determine the effectiveness of test suites through mutation scoring. Although mutation testing is effective, the cost of implementing it, due to the problem of equivalent mutants, is very high. Many research works gave varying solutions to this problem, but none used a standardized dataset. In this research work, we employed a standard mutant dataset tool called MutantBench to generate our data. Subsequently, an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) was used in conjunction with a tree-based convolutional neural network (TBCNN) as our deep learning model to automate the classification of the equivalent mutants to reduce the cost of mutation testing in software testing of android applications. The result shows that the proposed model produces a good accuracy rate of 94%, as well as other performance metrics such as recall (96%), precision (89%), F1-score (92%), and Matthew's correlation coefficients (88%) with fewer False Negatives and False Positives during testing, which is significant as it implies that there is a decrease in the risk of misclassification.

AB Nowadays, there is a growing interest in the use of Natural-Language Processing (NLP) for supporting software test automation. This paper investigates the adoption of NLP in web testing. To this aim, a case study has been conducted to compare the cost of the adoption of a NLP testing approach, with respect to more consolidated approaches, i.e., programmable testing and capture and replay testing, in two testing tasks: test cases development and test case evolution/maintenance. Even if preliminary, results show that NLP testing is quite competitive with respect to the more consolidated approaches since the cumulative testing effort of a NLP testing approach, computed considering both development and evolution efforts, is almost always lower than the one of programmable testing and capture&replay testing.

AB Featured Application DePaaS has the potential to be used as a global, shared platform for availing software defects prediction services by choosing appropriate base project, defect prediction model and prediction granularity. Over time, DePaaS can potentially become a rich source of defects metadata and provide deep insights into developing efficient software defects prediction models. It can promote inter-agency collaboration, data sharing, continuous improvement, and further research into application of artificial intelligence, genetic programming, and other techniques for solving key problems of software engineering. Using artificial intelligence (AI) based software defect prediction (SDP) techniques in the software development process helps isolate defective software modules, count the number of software defects, and identify risky code changes. However, software development teams are unaware of SDP and do not have easy access to relevant models and techniques. The major reason for this problem seems to be the fragmentation of SDP research and SDP practice. To unify SDP research and practice this article introduces a cloud-based, global, unified AI framework for SDP called DePaaS-Defects Prediction as a Service. The article describes the usage context, use cases and detailed architecture of DePaaS and presents the first response of the industry practitioners to DePaaS. In a first of its kind survey, the article captures practitioner's belief into SDP and ability of DePaaS to solve some of the known challenges of the field of software defect prediction. This article also provides a novel process for SDP, detailed description of the structure and behaviour of DePaaS architecture components, six best SDP models offered by DePaaS, a description of algorithms that recommend SDP models, feature sets and tunable parameters, and a rich set of challenges to build, use and sustain DePaaS. With the contributions of this article, SDP research and practice could be unified enabling building and using more pragmatic defect prediction models leading to increase in the efficiency of software testing.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a core feature of today's real-world applications, making it a trending topic within the software engineering (SE) community. The rise in the availability of AI techniques encompasses the capability to make rapid, automated, impactful decisions and predictions, leading to the adoption of AI techniques in SE. With industry revolution 4.0, the role of software engineering has become critical for developing productive, efficient, and quality software. Thus, there is a major need for AI techniques to be applied to enhance and improve the critical activities within the software engineering phases. Software is developed through intelligent software engineering phases. This paper concerns a systematic mapping study that aimed to characterize the publication landscape of AI techniques in software engineering. Gaps are identified and discussed by mapping these AI techniques against the SE phases to which they contributed. Many systematic mapping review papers have been produced only for a specific AI technique or a specific SE phase or activity. Hence, to our best of knowledge within the last decade, there is no systematic mapping review that has fully explored the overall trends in AI techniques and their application to all SE phases.

AB The automation of functional testing in software has allowed developers to continuously check for negative impacts on functionality throughout the iterative phases of development. This is not the case for User eXperience (UX), which has hitherto relied almost exclusively on testing with real users. User testing is a slow endeavour that can become a bottleneck for development of interactive systems. To address this problem, we here propose an agent based approach for automatic UX testing. We develop agents with basic problem solving skills and a core affect model, allowing us to model an artificial affective state as they traverse different levels of a game. Although this research is still at a primordial state, we believe the results here presented make a strong case for the use of intelligent agents endowed with affective computing models for automating UX testing.

DE RESTful web API; web services testing; artificial neural network
AB Automated test case generation for RESTful web APIs is a thriving research topic due to their key role in software integration. Most approaches in this domain follow a black-box approach, where test cases are randomly derived from the API specification. These techniques show promising results, but they neglect constraints among input parameters (so-called interparameter dependencies), as these cannot be formally described in current API specification languages. As a result, when testing real-world services, most random test cases tend to be invalid since they violate some of the inter-parameter dependencies of the service, making human intervention indispensable. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach for automatically predicting the validity of an API request (i.e., test input) before calling the actual API. The model is trained with the API requests and responses collected during the generation and execution of previous test cases. Preliminary results with five real-world RESTful APIs and 16K automatically generated test cases show that test inputs validity can be predicted with an accuracy ranging from 86% to 100% in APIs like Yelp, GitHub, and YouTube. These are encouraging results that show the potential of artificial intelligence to improve current test case generation techniques.

AB Test automation is common in software development; often one tests repeatedly to identify regressions. If the amount of test cases is large, one may select a subset and only use the most important test cases. The regression test selection (RTS) could be automated and enhanced with Artificial Intelligence (AI-RTS). This however could introduce ethical challenges. While such challenges in AI are in general well studied, there is a gap with respect to ethical AI-RTS. By exploring the literature and learning from our experiences of developing an industry AI-RTS tool, we contribute to the literature by identifying three challenges (assigning responsibility, bias in decision-making and lack of participation) and three approaches (explicability, supervision and diversity). Additionally, we provide a checklist for ethical AI-RTS to help guide the decision-making of the stakeholders involved in the process.

AB Detecting the dependency between integration test cases plays a vital role in the area of software test optimization. Classifying test cases into two main classes - dependent and independent - can be employed for several test optimization purposes such as parallel test execution, test automation, test case selection and prioritization, and test suite reduction. This task can be seen as an imbalanced classification problem due to the test cases' distribution. Often the number of dependent and independent test cases is uneven, which is related to the testing level, testing environment and complexity of the system under test. In this study, we propose a novel methodology that consists of two main steps. Firstly, by using natural language processing we analyze the test cases' specifications and turn them into a numeric vector. Secondly, by using the obtained data vectors, we classify each test case into a dependent or an independent class. We carry out a supervised learning approach using different methods for handling imbalanced datasets. The feasibility and possible generalization of the proposed methodology is evaluated in two industrial projects at Bombardier Transportation, Sweden, which indicates promising results.

AB Software quality plays an important role in the software lifecycle. Traditional software defect prediction approaches mainly focused on using hand-crafted features to detect defects. However, like human languages, programming languages contain rich semantic and structural information, and the cause of defective code is closely related to its context. Failing to catch this significant information, the performance of traditional approaches is far from satisfactory. In this study, the authors leveraged a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to automatically learn the semantic and contextual features from the source code. Specifically, they first extract the program's Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), which is made up of AST nodes, and then evaluate what and how much information they can preserve for several node types. They traverse the AST of each file and fed them into the LSTM network to automatically the semantic and contextual features of the program, which is then used to determine whether the file is defective. Experimental results on several opensource projects showed that the proposed LSTM method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Artificial intelligence is one of the key technologies for progression to the fourth industrial revolution. This technology also has a significant impact on software professionals who are continuously striving to achieve high-quality software development by fixing various types of software bugs. During the software development and maintenance stages, software bugs are the major factor that can affect the cost and time of software delivery. To efficiently fix a software bug, open bug repositories are used for identifying bug reports and for classifying and prioritizing the reports for assignment to the most appropriate software developers based on their level of interest and expertise. Owing to a lack of resources such as time and manpower, this bug report triage process is extremely important in software development. To improve the bug report triage performance, numerous studies have focused on a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) using the k-nearest neighbors or a support vector machine. Although the existing approaches have improved the accuracy of a bug triage, they often cause conflicts between the combined techniques and generate incorrect triage results. In this study, we propose a method for improving the bug report triage performance using multiple LDA-based topic sets by improving the LDA. The proposed method improves the existing topic sets of the LDA by building two adjunct topic sets. In our experiment, we collected bug reports from a popular bug tracking system, Bugzilla, as well as Android bug reports, to evaluate the proposed method and demonstrate the achievement of the following two goals: increase the bug report triage accuracy, and satisfy the compatibility with other state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Complexity of web systems lead to development processes always more tough to test. Testing phases are crucial in software and system engineering and are known to be very costly. While automated testing methods appear to take over the role of the human testers, the issues of reliability and the capability of the testing method still need to be solved. In our paper, we focus on the automation of functional tests of websites. A single web page may contain a huge set of important functionalities leading to the execution of critical web service operations. Besides, testing all of these functionalities implemented in a web page service is highly complex. Two current popular research areas for automation web-based testing are Codeless Functional Test Automation and Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI) in test automation. We therefore define and implement a framework to figure out how to automate the web service product under test, the machine can detect or predict the change and adapt those changes to suitable generic test cases. In our work, we examine on Selenium and the benefits of using machine learning in automated web application testing.

ID GENERATION
AB Software testing is a vital and complex part of the software development life cycle. Optimization of software testing is still a major challenge, as prioritization of test cases remains unsatisfactory in terms of Average Percentage of Faults Detected (APFD) and time execution performance. This is attributed to a large search space to find an optimal ordering of test cases. In this paper, we have proposed an approach to prioritize test cases optimally using Firefly Algorithm. To optimize the ordering of test cases, we applied Firefly Algorithm with fitness function defined using a similarity distance model. Experiments were carried on three benchmark programs with test suites extracted from Software-artifact Infrastructure Repository (SIR). Our Test Case Prioritization (TCP) technique using Firefly Algorithm with similarity distance model demonstrated better if not equal in terms of APFD and time execution performance compared to existing works. Overall APFD results indicate that Firefly Algorithm is a promising competitor in TCP applications.

AB Software testing is an important but expensive activity of software development life cycle, as it accounts for more than 52% of entire development cost. Testing requires the execution of all possible test cases in order to find the defects in the software. Therefore, different test suite optimization approaches like the genetic algorithm and the greedy algorithm, etc., are widely used to select the representative test suite without compromising the effectiveness. Test suite optimization is frequently researched to enhance its competences but there is no study published until now that analyzes the latest developments from 2016 to 2019. Hence, in this article, we systematically examine the state-of-the-art optimizations' approaches, tools, and supporting platforms. Principally, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to inspect and examine 58 selected studies that are published during 2016-2019. Subsequently, the selected researches are grouped into five main categories, i.e., greedy algorithm (seven studies), meta-heuristic (28 studies), hybrid (six studies), clustering (five studies), and general (12 studies). Finally, 32 leading tools have been presented, i.e., existing tools (25 tools) and proposed/developed tools (seven tools) along 14 platform supports. Furthermore, it is noted that several approaches aim at solving the single-objective optimization problem. Therefore, researchers should focus on dealing with the multi-objective problem, as multi-objective versions outperform the single-objective ones. Moreover, less attention has been given to clustering-based techniques. Thus, we recommend exploring the machine learning and artificial intelligence-based optimization approaches in the future. A broad exploration of tools and techniques, in this article, will help researchers, practitioners, and developers to opt for adequate techniques, tools, or platforms as per requirements.

AB Security breaches due to attacks by malicious software (malware) continue to escalate posing a major security concern in this digital age. With many computer users, corporations, and governments affected due to an exponential growth in malware attacks, malware detection continues to be a hot research topic. Current malware detection solutions that adopt the static and dynamic analysis of malware signatures and behavior patterns are time consuming and have proven to be ineffective in identifying unknown malwares in real-time. Recent malwares use polymorphic, metamorphic, and other evasive techniques to change the malware behaviors quickly and to generate a large number of new malwares. Such new malwares are predominantly variants of existing malwares, and machine learning algorithms (MLAs) are being employed recently to conduct an effective malware analysis. However, such approaches are time consuming as they require extensive feature engineering, feature learning, and feature representation. By using the advanced MLAs such as deep learning, the feature engineering phase can be completely avoided. Recently reported research studies in this direction show the performance of their algorithms with a biased training data, which limits their practical use in real-time situations. There is a compelling need to mitigate bias and evaluate these methods independently in order to arrive at a new enhanced method for effective zero-day malware detection. To fill the gap in the literature, this paper, first, evaluates the classical MLAs and deep learning architectures for malware detection, classification, and categorization using different public and private datasets. Second, we remove all the dataset bias removed in the experimental analysis by having different splits of the public and private datasets to train and test the model in a disjoint way using different timescales. Third, our major contribution is in proposing a novel image processing technique with optimal parameters for MLAs and deep learning architectures to arrive at an effective zero-day malware detection model. A comprehensive comparative study of our model demonstrates that our proposed deep learning architectures outperform classical MLAs. Our novelty in combining visualization and deep learning architectures for static, dynamic, and image processing-based hybrid approach applied in a big data environment is the first of its kind toward achieving robust intelligent zero-day malware detection.
