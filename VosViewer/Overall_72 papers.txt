AB The study introduces a new method for predicting software defects based on Residual/Shuffle (RS) Networks and an enhanced version of Fish Migration Optimization (UFMO). The overall contribution is to improve the accuracy, and reduce the manual effort needed. The originality of this work rests in the synergic use of deep learning and metaheuristics to train the software code for extraction of semantic and structural properties. The model is tested on a variety of open-source projects, yielding an average accuracy of 93% and surpassing the performance of the state-of-the-art models. The results indicate an overall increase in the precision (78-98%), recall (71-98%), F-measure (72-96%), and Area Under the Curve (AUC) (78-99%). The proposed model is simple and efficient and proves to be effective in identifying potential defects, consequently decreasing the chance of missing these defects and improving the overall quality of the software as opposed to existing approaches. However, the analysis is limited to open-source projects and warrants further evaluation on proprietary software. The study enables a robust and efficient tool for developers. This approach can revolutionize software development practices in order to use artificial intelligence to solve difficult issues presented in software. The model offers high accuracy to reduce the software development cost, which can improve user satisfaction, and enhance the overall quality of software being developed.

AB Ambiguity in software requirements is a significant challenge as it often leads to misunderstandings, implementation errors, and costly project delays. This research proposes a hybrid framework that combines rule-based techniques with machine learning to identify ambiguity in software requirements with precision and efficiency. The framework begins with a rule-based model that systematically detects ambiguities using a carefully prepared list of ambiguous phrases. The analysis utilizes a dataset of 1,553 software requirements drawn from diverse project domains. To capture more intricate ambiguities that traditional rule-based systems might miss, the framework integrates TF-IDF vectorization and a Random Forest classifier, enhancing the precision and coverage of classification. In addition, clustering analysis identifies patterns to provide deeper insights into ambiguous requirements, while sentiment analysis explores the relationship between ambiguity and the emotional tone of requirements. Together, these analyses offer a broader understanding of ambiguity trends and stakeholder perceptions. The framework's performance is validated using standard evaluation metrics, achieving an accuracy of 97%, precision of 97%, recall of 89%, and an F1-score of 92%, significantly surpassing traditional rule-based methodologies. This research advances automatic ambiguity detection by delivering a flexible and interpretable solution. The proposed approach enhances the clarity and quality of software requirements, strengthening requirements engineering practices and supporting more effective software development.

ID FEATURE-SELECTION
AB The development of reliable software depends heavily on the effective collaboration between teams responsible for development and testing. Despite ongoing efforts, many software programs still contain bugs that can lead to financial losses and business risks. Therefore, detecting and fixing software defects after release is crucial. While binary classification methods have been commonly used for this purpose, recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) advancements offer new opportunities for software teams to create more robust software. To address challenges in Software Defect Prediction (SDP), we conducted a thorough bibliographic survey of 79 research articles from the year 2011 to 2023 that examined previous models, datasets, data validation techniques, defect detection, prediction methods, and SDP tools. The survey revealed that previous research often lacked appropriate datasets with the necessary characteristics and data validation methods. Additionally, many standard datasets suffer from a lack of labels, which hinders effective defect detection. Systematic literature reviews on SDP are scarce, further emphasizing the importance of this study. Based on the findings, we provide crucial recommendations for designing effective SDP models and tools. The proposed survey outlines an architecture for constructing SDP datasets with the appropriate characteristics, as well as multi-label classification and data validation methodologies for software defects. This approach aims to enhance SDP research and contribute to the development of high-quality software products by improving defect prediction accuracy.

ID PREDICTION
AB Machine learning (ML) models have gained significant attention in a variety of applications, from computer vision to natural language processing, and are almost always based on big data. There are a growing number of applications and products with built-in machine learning models, and this is the area where software engineering, artificial intelligence and data science meet. The requirement for a system to operate in a real-world environment poses many challenges, such as how to design for wrong predictions the model may make; How to assure safety and security despite possible mistakes; which qualities matter beyond a model's prediction accuracy; How can we identify and measure important quality requirements, including learning and inference latency, scalability, explainability, fairness, privacy, robustness, and safety. It has become crucial to test thoroughly these models to assess their capabilities and potential errors. Existing software testing methods have been adapted and refined to discover faults in machine learning and deep learning models. This paper covers a taxonomy, a methodologically uniform presentation of all presented solutions to the aforementioned issues, as well as conclusions about possible future development trends. The main contributions of this paper are a classification that closely follows the structure of the ML-pipeline, a precisely defined role of each team member within that pipeline, an overview of trends and challenges in the combination of ML and big data analytics, with uses in the domains of industry and education.

DE AI; machine learning; code detection; ChatGPT; large language models
AB In recent times, large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in generating computer code, blurring the lines between code created by humans and code produced by artificial intelligence (AI). As these technologies evolve rapidly, it is crucial to explore how they influence code generation, especially given the risk of misuse in areas such as higher education. The present paper explores this issue by using advanced classification techniques to differentiate between code written by humans and code generated by ChatGPT, a type of LLM. We employ a new approach that combines powerful embedding features (black-box) with supervised learning algorithms including Deep Neural Networks, Random Forests, and Extreme Gradient Boosting to achieve this differentiation with an impressive accuracy of 98%. For the successful combinations, we also examine their model calibration, showing that some of the models are extremely well calibrated. Additionally, we present white-box features and an interpretable Bayes classifier to elucidate critical differences between the code sources, enhancing the explainability and transparency of our approach. Both approaches work well, but provide at most 85-88% accuracy. Tests on a small sample of untrained humans suggest that humans do not solve the task much better than random guessing. This study is crucial in understanding and mitigating the potential risks associated with using AI in code generation, particularly in the context of higher education, software development, and competitive programming.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed an exponential increase in use in various applications. Recently, the academic community started to research and inject new AI-based approaches to provide solutions to traditional software-engineering problems. However, a comprehensive and holistic understanding of the current status needs to be included. To close the above gap, synthetic knowledge synthesis was used to induce the research landscape of the contemporary research literature on the use of AI in software engineering. The synthesis resulted in 15 research categories and 5 themes-namely, natural language processing in software engineering, use of artificial intelligence in the management of the software development life cycle, use of machine learning in fault/defect prediction and effort estimation, employment of deep learning in intelligent software engineering and code management, and mining software repositories to improve software quality. The most productive country was China (n = 2042), followed by the United States (n = 1193), India (n = 934), Germany (n = 445), and Canada (n = 381). A high percentage (n = 47.4%) of papers were funded, showing the strong interest in this research topic. The convergence of AI and software engineering can significantly reduce the required resources, improve the quality, enhance the user experience, and improve the well-being of software developers.

AB The advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence is opening essential questions about whether and when AI will replace human abilities in accomplishing everyday tasks. This issue is particularly true in the domain of software development, where generative AI seems to have strong skills in solving coding problems and generating software source code. In this paper, an empirical evaluation of AI-generated source code is performed: three complex coding problems (selected from the exams for the Java Programming course at the University of Insubria) are prompted to three different Large Language Model (LLM) Engines, and the generated code is evaluated in its correctness and quality by means of human-implemented test suites and quality metrics. The experimentation shows that the three evaluated LLM engines are able to solve the three exams but with the constant supervision of software experts in performing these tasks. Currently, LLM engines need human-expert support to produce running code that is of good quality.

AB Data clumps, groups of variables that repeatedly appear together across different parts of a software system, are indicative of poor code structure and can lead to potential issues such as maintenance challenges, testing complexity, and scalability concerns, among others. Addressing this, our study introduces an innovative AI-driven pipeline specifically designed for the refactoring of data clumps in software repositories. This pipeline leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM), such as ChatGPT, to automate the detection and resolution of data clumps, thereby enhancing code quality and maintainability. In developing this pipeline, we have taken into consideration the new European Union (EU)-Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act, ensuring that our pipeline complies with the latest regulatory requirements and ethical standards for use of AI in software development by outsourcing decisions to a human in the loop. Preliminary experiments utilizing ChatGPT were conducted to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. These tests demonstrate promising results in identifying and refactoring data clumps, but also the challenges using LLMs.

AB Context: Artificial intelligence (AI) methods and models have extensively been applied to support different phases of the software development lifecycle, including software testing (ST). Several secondary studies investigated the interplay between AI and ST but restricted the scope of the research to specific domains or sub-domains within either area.
   Objective: This research aims to explore the overall contribution of AI to ST, while identifying the most popular applications and potential paths for future research directions.
   Method: We executed a tertiary study following well-established guidelines for conducting systematic literature mappings in software engineering and for answering nine research questions. Results: We identified and analyzed 20 relevant secondary studies. The analysis was performed by drawing from well-recognized AI and ST taxonomies and mapping the selected studies according to them. The resulting mapping and discussions provide extensive and detailed information on the interplay between AI and ST.
   Conclusion: The application of AI to support ST is a well-consolidated and growing interest research topic. The mapping resulting from our study can be used by researchers to identify opportunities for future research, and by practitioners looking for evidence-based information on which AI-supported technology to possibly adopt in their testing processes.

   Survey study; Practitioners' perspective
AB Machine learning is part of the daily life of people and companies worldwide. Unfortunately, bias in machine learning algorithms risks unfairly influencing the decision-making process and reiterating possible discrimination. While the interest of the software engineering community in software fairness is rapidly increasing, there is still a lack of understanding of various aspects connected to fair machine learning engineering, i.e., the software engineering process involved in developing fairness-critical machine learning systems. Questions connected to the practitioners' awareness and maturity about fairness, the skills required to deal with the matter, and the best development phase(s) where fairness should be faced more are just some examples of the knowledge gaps currently open. In this paper, we provide insights into how fairness is perceived and managed in practice, to shed light on the instruments and approaches that practitioners might employ to properly handle fairness. We conducted a survey with 117 professionals who shared their knowledge and experience highlighting the relevance of fairness in practice, and the skills and tools required to handle it. The key results of our study show that fairness is still considered a second-class quality aspect in the development of artificial intelligence systems. The building of specific methods and development environments, other than automated validation tools, might help developers to treat fairness throughout the software lifecycle and revert this trend.

AB The synergy between software engineering (SE) and artificial intelligence (AI) catalyzes software development, as numerous recent studies illustrate an intensified intersection between these domains. This systematic literature review examines the integration of AI techniques or methodologies across SE phases and related activities spanning from 2013 to 2023, resulting in the selection of 110 research papers. Investigating the profound influence of AI techniques, including machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, optimization algorithms, and expert systems, across various SE phases-such as planning, requirement engineering, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance-is the focal point of this study. Notably, the extensive adoption of machine learning and deep learning algorithms in the development and testing phases has enhanced software quality through defect prediction, code recommendation, and vulnerability detection initiatives. Furthermore, natural language processing's role in automating requirements classification and sentiment analysis has streamlined SE practices. Optimization algorithms have also demonstrated efficacy in refining SE activities such as feature location and software repair action predictions, augmenting precision and efficiency in maintenance endeavors. Prospective research emphasizes the imperative of interpretable AI models and the exploration of novel AI paradigms, including explainable AI and reinforcement learning, to promote ethical and efficient software development practices. This paper fills the gap identified in AI techniques dedicated to improving SE phases. The review concludes that AI in SE is revolutionizing the discipline, enhancing software quality, efficiency, and innovation, with ongoing efforts targeting the mitigation of identified limitations and the augmentation of AI capabilities for intelligent and dependable SE.

DE OpenAI ChatGPT; GitHub Copilot; code quality
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly popular in software development to automate tasks and improve efficiency. AI has the potential to help while developing or maintaining software, in the sense that it can produce solutions out of a textual requirement specification, and understand code to provide suggestion on how a new requirement could be implemented. In this paper, we focus on the first scenario. Two AI-powered tools that have the potential to revolutionize the way software is developed are OpenAI's ChatGPT and GitHub's Copilot. In this paper, we used LeetCode, a popular platform for technical interview preparation and personal upskilling (self-learning), to evaluate the effectiveness of ChatGPT and Copilot on a set of coding problems, along with ChatGPT's ability to correct itself when provided with feedback. The analysis of the effectiveness can lead to various conclusions, such as on if these solutions are ready to take over coding roles, and to what extent several parameters (difficulty and quality requirements) influence this result. Solutions have been generated for 60 problems using ChatGPT and Copilot, for the Python programming language. We investigated the performance of the models, the recurrent kinds of errors, and the resulting code quality. The evaluation revealed that ChatGPT and Copilot can be effective tools for generating code solutions for easy problems while both models are prone to syntax and semantic errors. Small improvements are observed for ode quality metrics across iterations, although the improvement pattern is not consistently monotonic, questioning ChatGPT's awareness of the quality of its own solutions. Nevertheless, the improvement that was found along iterations, highlights the potential of AI and humans, acting as partners, in providing the optimal combination. The two models demonstrate a limited capacity for understanding context. Although AI-powered coding tools driven by large language models have the potential to assist developers in their coding tasks, they should be used with caution and in conjunction with human coding expertise. Developer intervention is necessary not only to debug errors but also to ensure high-quality and optimized code.

AB The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized various domains of artificial intelligence, including the realm of software engineering. In this research, we evaluate the efficacy of pre-trained LLMs in replicating the tasks traditionally performed by developers in response to code review comments. We provide code contexts to five popular LLMs and obtain the suggested code-changes (patch sets) derived from real-world code-review comments. The performance of each model is meticulously assessed by comparing their generated patch sets against the historical data of human-generated patch-sets from the same repositories. This comparative analysis aims to determine the accuracy, relevance, and depth of the LLMs' feedback, thereby evaluating their readiness to support developers in responding to code-review comments. Novelty: This particular research area is still immature requiring a substantial amount of studies yet to be done. No prior research has compared the performance of existing Large Language Models (LLMs) in code-review comments. This in-progress study assesses current LLMs in code review and paves the way for future advancements in automated code quality assurance, reducing context-switching overhead due to interruptions from code change requests.

AB Large Language Models (LLMs) have grown in popularity in recent years and are now employed in a variety of software engineering domains thanks to their Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities, which include source code generation, understanding, and documentation. Selecting the appropriate model for source code generation presents a problem to developers as more and more powerful LLMs become available. While some studies have evaluated Copilot or ChatGPT, there is a lack of research on how developers can choose from available LLMs, which is a key factor in the growing set of available models and services. It is crucial to know if a model is capable of generating useful source code that meets the quality requirements and if the developers will be able to use the generated code. Regarding these factors, one has to decide which model to utilize during everyday tasks. This paper shows a methodology to compare such models by demonstrating an actual comparison of two models. Subsequently, we investigated the functional and non-functional qualities of the code synthesized by the models on a program synthesis benchmark containing 25 tasks. On average, the functional testing shows that ChatGPT generated 17 perfect solutions, while Copilot could only solve 13. The non-functional analysis reflected that both models generated good quality code, however, both have characteristic code smells. Our evaluation shows that ChatGPT performs better using this methodology, which is supported by human reviewers who evaluated the generated code by hand.

AB Scaled agile development approaches are now used widely in modern software engineering, allowing businesses to improve teamwork, productivity, and product quality. The incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) into scaled agile development methods (SADMs) has emerged as a potential strategy in response to the ongoing demand for simplified procedures and the increasing complexity of software projects. This paper explores the intersection of AI-driven assistants within the context of the scaled agile framework (SAFe) for large-scale software development, as it stands out as the most widely adopted framework. Our paper pursues three principal objectives: (1) an evaluation of the challenges and impediments encountered by organizations during the implementation of SADMs, (2) an assessment of the potential advantages stemming from the incorporation of AI in large-scale contexts, and (3) the compilation of aspects of SADMs that AI-driven assistants enhance. Through a comprehensive systematic literature review, we identified and described 18 distinct challenges that organizations confront. In the course of our research, we pinpointed seven benefits and five challenges associated with the implementation of AI in SADMs. These findings were systematically categorized based on their occurrence either within the development phase or the phases encompassing planning and control. Furthermore, we compiled a list of 15 different AI-driven assistants and tools, subjecting them to a more detailed examination, and employing them to address the challenges we uncovered during our research. One of the key takeaways from this paper is the exceptional versatility and effectiveness of AI-driven assistants, demonstrating their capability to tackle a broader spectrum of problems. In conclusion, this paper not only sheds light on the transformative potential of AI, but also provides invaluable insights for organizations aiming to enhance their agility and management capabilities.

AB Context: Software testing is applied to validate the behavior of the software system and identify flaws and bugs. Different machine learning technique types such as supervised and unsupervised learning were utilized in software testing. However, for some complex software testing scenarios, neither supervised nor unsupervised machine learning techniques were adequate. As such, researchers applied Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques in some cases. However, a systematic overview of the state-of-the-art on the role of reinforcement learning in software testing is lacking.Objective: The objective of this study is to determine how and to what extent RL was used in software testing.Methods: In this study, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted on the use of RL in software testing, and 40 primary studies were investigated.Results: This study highlights different software testing types to which RL has been applied, commonly used RL algorithms and architecture for learning, challenges faced, advantages and disadvantages of using RL, and the performance comparison of RL-based models against other techniques.Conclusions: RL has been widely used in software testing but has almost narrowed to two applications. There is a shortage of papers using advanced RL techniques in addition to multi-agent RL. Several challenges were presented in this study.

   Foundational ontologies; Ethicality requirements; Ethical systems
AB In a world where Artificial Intelligence (AI) is pervasive, humans may feel threatened or at risk by giving up control to machines. In this context, ethicality becomes a major concern to prevent AI systems from being biased, making mistakes, or going rogue. Requirements Engineering (RE) is the research area that can exert a great impact in the development of ethical systems by design. However, proposing concepts, tools and techniques that support the incorporation of ethicality into the software development processes as explicit requirements remains a great challenge in the RE field. In this paper, we rely on Ontology-based Requirements Engineering (ObRE) as a method to elicit and analyze ethicality requirements ('Ethicality requirements' is adopted as a name for the class of requirements studied in this paper by analogy to other quality requirements studied in software engineering, such as usability, reliability, and portability, etc. The use of this term (as opposed to 'ethical requirements') highlights that they represent requirements for ethical systems, analogous to how 'trustworthiness requirements' represent requirements for trustworthy systems. To put simply: the predicates 'ethical' or 'trustworthy' are not meant to be predicated over the requirements themselves). ObRE applies ontological analysis to ontologically unpack terms and notions that are referred to in requirements elicitation. Moreover, this method instantiates the adopted ontology and uses it to guide the requirements analysis activity. In a previous paper, we presented a solution concerning two ethical principles, namely Beneficence and Non-maleficence. The present paper extends the previous work by targeting two other important ethicality principles, those of Explicability and Autonomy. For each of these new principles, we do ontological unpacking of the relevant concepts, and we present requirements elicitation and analysis guidelines, as well as examples in the context of a driverless car case. Furthermore, we validate our approach by analysing the requirements elicitation made for the driverless car case in contrast with a similar case, and by assessing our method's coverage w.r.t European Union guidelines for Trustworthy AI.

AB Context: Artificial intelligence (AI) components used in building software solutions have substantially increased in recent years. However, many of these solutions focus on technical aspects and ignore critical human-centered aspects.Objective: Including human-centered aspects during requirements engineering (RE) when building AI-based software can help achieve more responsible, unbiased, and inclusive AI-based software solutions.Method: In this paper, we present a new framework developed based on human-centered AI guidelines and a user survey to aid in collecting requirements for human-centered AI-based software. We provide a catalog to elicit these requirements and a conceptual model to present them visually.Results: The framework is applied to a case study to elicit and model requirements for enhancing the quality of 360 degrees videos intended for virtual reality (VR) users.Conclusion: We found that our proposed approach helped the project team fully understand the human-centered needs of the project to deliver. Furthermore, the framework helped to understand what requirements need to be captured at the initial stages against later stages in the engineering process of AI-based software.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB Context: Engineering Artificial Intelligence (AI) software is a relatively new area with many challenges, unknowns, and limited proven best practices. Big companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Apple have provided a suite of recent guidelines to assist engineering teams in building human-centered AI systems.Objective: The practices currently adopted by practitioners for developing such systems, especially during Requirements Engineering (RE), are little studied and reported to date. Method: This paper presents the results of a survey conducted to understand current industry practices in RE for AI (RE4AI) and to determine which key human-centered AI guidelines should be followed. Our survey is based on mapping existing industrial guidelines, best practices, and efforts in the literature.Results: We surveyed 29 professionals and found most participants agreed that all the human-centered aspects we mapped should be addressed in RE. Further, we found that most participants were using UML or Microsoft Office to present requirements.Conclusion: We identify that most of the tools currently used are not equipped to manage AI-based software, and the use of UML and Office may pose issues with the quality of requirements captured for AI. Also, all human-centered practices mapped from the guidelines should be included in RE. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB It gets harder and harder to guarantee the quality of software systems due to their increasing complexity and fast development. Because it helps spot errors and gaps during the first phases of software development, software testing is one of the most crucial stages of software engineering. Software testing used to be done manually, which is a time-consuming, imprecise procedure that comes with errors and gaps and costs money, time, and effort. Currently, testing professionals routinely automate testing to obtain trustworthy results while saving time, cost, and labor. We've also moved the starting point of the software cycle to the developer, and made write tests before even writing code, or what's known as TDD (Test Driven Development). The use of new artificial intelligence techniques will enable the generation of smart test cases to improve test quality and provide better coverage and accurate results. In this study, we used the Web of Science database to acquire bibliometric data about intelligent software testing papers which were conducted between 2012 and 2022, and we used Biblioshiny from the R bibliomerix package, alongside with VOSViewer in order to analyze the data and extract insights and answer research questions about the authors, articles, journals, organizations, and countries publishing in the field of intelligent software testing. The focus of this study is on scientific progress and collaborative trends in scholarly research, providing a blueprint for showcasing worldwide developments in the realm of intelligent software testing. By gaining a comprehensive understanding of the present state of research on the application of artificial intelligence in software testing, this study can offer valuable insights to software engineers, architects, and researchers in the field.

AB The recent popularity of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) corresponds with an increase in the risk of cyber-attacks. These cyber-attacks are instigated by white-coat hackers, and cyber-criminals. As Connected Vehicles move towards full autonomy the impact of these cyber-attacks also grows. The current research highlights challenges faced in cybersecurity testing of CAV, including access, the cost of representative test setup and the lack of experts in the field. Possible solutions of how these challenges can be overcome are reviewed and discussed. From these findings a software simulated Vehicular Ad Hoc NETwork (VANET) is established as a costeffective representative testbed. Penetration tests are then performed on this simulation, demonstrating a cyberattack in CAV. Studies have shown Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve runtime, increase efficiency and comprehensively cover all the typical test aspects, in penetration testing in other industries. In this research a Reinforcement Learning model, called Q-Learning, is applied to automate the software simulation. The expectation from this implementation is to see improvements in runtime and efficiency for the VANET model. The results show this approach to be promising and using AI in penetration testing for VANET to improve efficiency in most cases. Each case is reviewed in detail before discussing possible ways to improve the implementation and get a truer reflection of the real-world application.

AB Companies struggle to continuously develop and deploy Artificial Intelligence (AI) models to complex production systems due to AI characteristics while assuring quality. To ease the development process, continuous pipelines for AI have become an active research area where consolidated and in-depth analysis regarding the terminology, triggers, tasks, and challenges is required.This paper includes a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) where we consolidated 151 relevant formal and informal sources. In addition, nine-semi structured interviews with participants from academia and industry verified and extended the obtained information. Based on these sources, this paper provides and compares terminologies for Development and Operations (DevOps) and Continuous Integration (CI)/Continuous Delivery (CD) for AI, Machine Learning Operations (MLOps), (end-to-end) lifecycle management, and Continuous Delivery for Machine Learning (CD4ML). Furthermore, the paper provides an aggregated list of potential triggers for reiterating the pipeline, such as alert systems or schedules. In addition, this work uses a taxonomy creation strategy to present a consolidated pipeline comprising tasks regarding the continuous development of AI. This pipeline consists of four stages: Data Handling, Model Learning, Software Development and System Operations. Moreover, we map challenges regarding pipeline implementation, adaption, and usage for the continuous development of AI to these four stages.(c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

ID FRAMEWORK; ALGORITHMS
AB Improving software quality by proactively detecting potential defects during development is a major goal of software engineering. Software defect prediction plays a central role in achieving this goal. The power of data analytics and machine learning allows us to focus our efforts where they are needed most. A key factor in the success of software fault prediction is selecting relevant features and reducing data dimensionality. Feature selection methods contribute by filtering out the most critical attributes from a plethora of potential features. These methods have the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of fault prediction models. However, the field of feature selection in the context of software fault prediction is vast and constantly evolving, with a variety of techniques and tools available. Based on these considerations, our systematic literature review conducts a comprehensive investigation of feature selection methods used in the context of software fault prediction. The research uses a refined search strategy involving four reputable digital libraries, including IEEE Explore, Science Direct, ACM Digital Library, and Springer Link, to provide a comprehensive and exhaustive review through a rigorous analysis of 49 selected primary studies from 2014. The results highlight several important issues. First, there is a prevalence of filtering and hybrid feature selection methods. Second, single classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree, as well as ensemble classifiers such as Random Forest, Bagging, and AdaBoost are commonly used. Third, evaluation metrics such as area under the curve, accuracy, and F-measure are commonly used for performance evaluation. Finally, there is a clear preference for tools such as WEKA, MATLAB, and Python. By providing insights into current trends and practices in the field, this study offers valuable guidance to researchers and practitioners to make informed decisions to improve software fault prediction models and contribute to the overall improvement of software quality.

AB Software requirements show what the customer desires his software to do. They are the first stepping stone towards a successful software development project. With the increasing complexity of the software due to its size and feature base, it is vital to prioritize the requirements for efficient utilization of development resources. To achieve this, industrial organizations are devising new strategies and improved solutions even with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) tool set. Existing requirements prioritization techniques are human-intensive and suffer from several limitations like overlapping outcomes, scalability problems, time consumption, inaccuracy, and so on. Some of the problems can be solved by including artificial intelligence algorithms and strategies. Several AI-based requirements prioritization techniques have been proposed by applying Genetic Algorithms, Fuzzy Logic, Ant Colony Optimization, and Machine Learning. Literature witnesses some good review studies and surveys on conventional prioritization techniques but there exists none for AI-based techniques that identify not only their strengths but also their weaknesses, advantages of machine learning techniques over other AI-based requirements prioritization techniques, and limitations of applying AI-based techniques in requirements prioritization. This study presents a systematic literature review (SLR) of AI-based requirements prioritization approaches covering 46 papers published from 2000 to 2021. We have given this literature review a new dimension by conducting a parametric analysis of AI-based requirements prioritization techniques and we have identified these parameters after a thorough literature study. Some of the chosen parameters are generic (related to the prioritization process) and some are specific (related to AI techniques). This study has greatly helped us draw a clear line among AI-based techniques to show their domain of application to gain maximum advantage. Our findings will assist researchers, requirement analysts, and other stakeholders in making a wise decision to select the best requirements prioritization technique to gain optimal results.

AB Machine learning (ML) techniques discover knowledge from large amounts of data. Modeling in ML is becoming essential to software systems in practice. The accuracy and efficiency of ML models have been focused on ML research communities, while there is less attention on validating the qualities of ML models. Validating ML applications is a challenging and time-consuming process for developers since prediction accuracy heavily relies on generated models. ML applications are written by relatively more data-driven programming based on the black box of ML frameworks. All of the datasets and the ML application need to be individually investigated. Thus, the ML validation tasks take a lot of time and effort. To address this limitation, we present a novel quality validation technique that increases the reliability for ML models and applications, called MLVal. Our approach helps developers inspect the training data and the generated features for the ML model. A data validation technique is important and beneficial to software quality since the quality of the input data affects speed and accuracy for training and inference. Inspired by software debugging/validation for reproducing the potential reported bugs, MLVal takes as input an ML application and its training datasets to build the ML models, helping ML application developers easily reproduce and understand anomalies in the ML application. We have implemented an Eclipse plugin for MLVal that allows developers to validate the prediction behavior of their ML applications, the ML model, and the training data on the Eclipse IDE. In our evaluation, we used 23,500 documents in the bioengineering research domain. We assessed the ability of the MLVal validation technique to effectively help ML application developers: (1) investigate the connection between the produced features and the labels in the training model, and (2) detect errors early to secure the quality of models from better data. Our approach reduces the cost of engineering efforts to validate problems, improving data-centric workflows of the ML application development.

AB The increasing integration of AI software into various aspects of our daily lives has amplified the importance of evaluating the quality of these intelligent systems. The rapid proliferation of AI-based software projects and the growing reliance on these systems underscore the urgency of examining their quality for practical applications in both industry and academia. This systematic literature review delves into the study of quality assessment metrics and methods for AI-based systems, pinpointing key attributes and properties of intelligent software projects that are crucial for determining their quality. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of this domain will enable researchers to devise novel methods and metrics for effectively and efficiently evaluating the quality of such systems. Despite its importance, this area of development is still relatively nascent and evolving. This paper presents a systematic review of the current state of the taxonomy of quality assessment for AI-based software. We analyzed 271 articles from six different sources that focused on the quality assessment of intelligent software systems. The primary objective of this work is to provide an overview of the field and consolidate knowledge, which will aid researchers in identifying additional areas for future research. Moreover, our findings reveal the necessity to establish remedial strategies and develop tools to automate the process of identifying appropriate actions in response to abnormal metric values.

AB Test case prioritisation (TCP) is a critical task in regression testing to ensure quality as software evolves. Machine learning has become a common way to achieve it. In particular, learning-to-rank (LTR) algorithms provide an effective method of ordering and prioritising test cases. However, their use poses a challenge in terms of explainability, both globally at the model level and locally for particular results. Here, we present and discuss scenarios that require different explanations and how the particularities of TCP (multiple builds over time, test case and test suite variations, etc.) could influence them. We include a preliminary experiment to analyse the similarity of explanations, showing that they do not only vary depending on test case-specific predictions, but also on the relative ranks.

AB The most significant invention made in recent years to serve various applications is software. Developing a faultless software system requires the soft-ware system design to be resilient. To make the software design more efficient, it is essential to assess the reusability of the components used. This paper proposes a software reusability prediction model named Flexible Random Fit (FRF) based on aging resilience for a Service Net (SN) software system. The reusability prediction model is developed based on a multilevel optimization technique based on software characteristics such as cohesion, coupling, and complexity. Metrics are obtained from the SN software system, which is then subjected to min-max normalization to avoid any saturation during the learning process. The feature extraction process is made more feasible by enriching the data quality via outlier detection. The reusability of the classes is estimated based on a tool called Soft Audit. Software reusability can be predicted more effectively based on the pro-posed FRF-ANN (Flexible Random Fit -Artificial Neural Network) algorithm. Performance evaluation shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms all the other techniques, thus ensuring the optimization of software reusability based on aging resilient. The model is then tested using constraint-based testing techniques to make sure that it is perfect at optimizing and making predictions.

AB Usage of Deep Learning (DL) methods is ubiquitous. It is common in the DL/Artificial Intelligence domain to use 3rd party software. TensorFlow is one of the most popular Machine Learning (ML) platforms. Every software product is a subject to security failures which often result from software vulnerabilities. In this paper, we focus on threats related to 6 common types of threats in TensorFlow implementation. We iden-tify them using Common Weakness Enumeration. We analyze more than 100 vulnerability instances. We focus on vulnerabilities' severity, impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability, as well as possible results of exploitation. We also use Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC). The results show that a ma-jority of vulnerabilities are caused by missing/incorrect checking statements, however some fixes require more advanced algorithmic changes. Static Analysis Tools tested in our study show low effectiveness in detecting known vulnerabilities in TensorFlow, but we provide some recommendations based on the ob-tained alerts to improve overall code quality. Further analysis of vulnerabilities helped us to understand and characterize different vulnerability types and provide a set of observations. We believe that these observations can be useful for the creators of new static analysis tools as a source of inspiration and to build the test cases. We also aim to draw the programmers' attention to the prevalence of vulnerabilities in deep learning applications and a low effectiveness of automatic tools to find software vulnerabilities in such products.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB The development of machine learning systems has to ensure their robustness and reliability. The authors introduce a framework that defines a principled process of machine learning system formation, from research to production, for various domains and data scenarios.
   The development and deployment of machine learning systems can be executed easily with modern tools, but the process is typically rushed and means-to-an-end. Lack of diligence can lead to technical debt, scope creep and misaligned objectives, model misuse and failures, and expensive consequences. Engineering systems, on the other hand, follow well-defined processes and testing standards to streamline development for high-quality, reliable results. The extreme is spacecraft systems, with mission critical measures and robustness throughout the process. Drawing on experience in both spacecraft engineering and machine learning (research through product across domain areas), we've developed a proven systems engineering approach for machine learning and artificial intelligence: the Machine Learning Technology Readiness Levels framework defines a principled process to ensure robust, reliable, and responsible systems while being streamlined for machine learning workflows, including key distinctions from traditional software engineering, and a lingua franca for people across teams and organizations to work collaboratively on machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies. Here we describe the framework and elucidate with use-cases from physics research to computer vision apps to medical diagnostics.

AB Software Quality Assurance (SQA) planning aims to define proactive plans, such as defining maximum file size, to prevent the occurrence of software defects in future releases. To aid this, defect prediction models have been proposed to generate insights as the most important factors that are associated with software quality. Such insights that are derived from traditional defect models are far from actionable-i.e., practitioners still do not know what they should do or avoid to decrease the risk of having defects, and what is the risk threshold for each metric. A lack of actionable guidance and risk threshold can lead to inefficient and ineffective SQA planning processes. In this paper, we investigate the practitioners' perceptions of current SQA planning activities, current challenges of such SQA planning activities, and propose four types of guidance to support SQA planning. We then propose and evaluate our AI-Driven SQAPlanner approach, a novel approach for generating four types of guidance and their associated risk thresholds in the form of rule-based explanations for the predictions of defect prediction models. Finally, we develop and evaluate a visualization for our SQAPlanner approach. Through the use of qualitative survey and empirical evaluation, our results lead us to conclude that SQAPlanner is needed, effective, stable, and practically applicable. We also find that 80 percent of our survey respondents perceived that our visualization is more actionable. Thus, our SQAPlanner paves a way for novel research in actionable software analytics-i.e., generating actionable guidance on what should practitioners do and not do to decrease the risk of having defects to support SQA planning.

AB Software and symmetric testing methodologies are primarily used in detecting software defects, but these testing methodologies need to be optimized to mitigate the wasting of resources. As mobile applications are becoming more prevalent in recent times, the need to have mobile applications that satisfy software quality through testing cannot be overemphasized. Testing suites and software quality assurance techniques have also become prevalent, which underscores the need to evaluate the efficacy of these tools in the testing of the applications. Mutation testing is one such technique, which is the process of injecting small changes into the software under test (SUT), thereby creating mutants. These mutants are then tested using mutation testing techniques alongside the SUT to determine the effectiveness of test suites through mutation scoring. Although mutation testing is effective, the cost of implementing it, due to the problem of equivalent mutants, is very high. Many research works gave varying solutions to this problem, but none used a standardized dataset. In this research work, we employed a standard mutant dataset tool called MutantBench to generate our data. Subsequently, an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) was used in conjunction with a tree-based convolutional neural network (TBCNN) as our deep learning model to automate the classification of the equivalent mutants to reduce the cost of mutation testing in software testing of android applications. The result shows that the proposed model produces a good accuracy rate of 94%, as well as other performance metrics such as recall (96%), precision (89%), F1-score (92%), and Matthew's correlation coefficients (88%) with fewer False Negatives and False Positives during testing, which is significant as it implies that there is a decrease in the risk of misclassification.

AB AI-based systems are software systems with functionalities enabled by at least one AI component (e.g., for image-, speech-recognition, and autonomous driving). AI-based systems are becoming pervasive in society due to advances in AI. However, there is limited synthesized knowledge on Software Engineering (SE) approaches for building, operating, and maintaining AI-based systems. To collect and analyze state-of-the-art knowledge about SE for AI-based systems, we conducted a systematic mapping study. We considered 248 studies published between January 2010 and March 2020. SE for AI-based systems is an emerging research area, where more than 2/3 of the studies have been published since 2018. The most studied properties of AI-based systems are dependability and safety. We identified multiple SE approaches for AI-based systems, which we classified according to the SWEBOK areas. Studies related to software testing and software quality are very prevalent, while areas like software maintenance seem neglected. Data-related issues are the most recurrent challenges. Our results are valuable for: researchers, to quickly understand the state-of-the-art and learn which topics need more research; practitioners, to learn about the approaches and challenges that SE entails for AI-based systems; and, educators, to bridge the gap among SE and AI in their curricula.

AB Testing has been widely recognised as difficult for AI applications. This paper proposes a set of testing strategies for testing machine learning applications in the framework of the datamorphism testing methodology. In these strategies, testing aims at exploring the data space of a classification or clustering application to discover the boundaries between classes that the machine learning application defines. This enables the tester to understand precisely the behaviour and function of the software under test. In the paper, three variants of exploratory strategies are presented with the algorithms implemented in the automated datamorphic testing tool Morphy. The correctness of these algorithms are formally proved. Their capability and cost of discovering borders between classes are evaluated via a set of controlled experiments with manually designed subjects and a set of case studies with real machine learning models.

AB Nowadays, there is a growing interest in the use of Natural-Language Processing (NLP) for supporting software test automation. This paper investigates the adoption of NLP in web testing. To this aim, a case study has been conducted to compare the cost of the adoption of a NLP testing approach, with respect to more consolidated approaches, i.e., programmable testing and capture and replay testing, in two testing tasks: test cases development and test case evolution/maintenance. Even if preliminary, results show that NLP testing is quite competitive with respect to the more consolidated approaches since the cumulative testing effort of a NLP testing approach, computed considering both development and evolution efforts, is almost always lower than the one of programmable testing and capture&replay testing.

AB AI ethics principles and guidelines are typically high-level and do not provide concrete guidance on how to develop responsible AI systems. To address this shortcoming, we perform an empirical study involving interviews with 21 scientists and engineers to understand the practitioners' views on AI ethics principles and their implementation. Our major findings are: (1) the current practice is often a done-once-and-forget type of ethical risk assessment at a particular development step, which is not sufficient for highly uncertain and continual learning AI systems; (2) ethical requirements are either omitted or mostly stated as high-level objectives, and not specified explicitly in verifiable way as system outputs or outcomes; (3) although ethical requirements have the characteristics of cross-cutting quality and non-functional requirements amenable to architecture and design analysis, system-level architecture and design are under-explored; (4) there is a strong desire for continuously monitoring and validating AI systems post deployment for ethical requirements but current operation practices provide limited guidance. To address these findings, we suggest a preliminary list of patterns to provide operationalised guidance for developing responsible AI systems.

AB Featured Application DePaaS has the potential to be used as a global, shared platform for availing software defects prediction services by choosing appropriate base project, defect prediction model and prediction granularity. Over time, DePaaS can potentially become a rich source of defects metadata and provide deep insights into developing efficient software defects prediction models. It can promote inter-agency collaboration, data sharing, continuous improvement, and further research into application of artificial intelligence, genetic programming, and other techniques for solving key problems of software engineering. Using artificial intelligence (AI) based software defect prediction (SDP) techniques in the software development process helps isolate defective software modules, count the number of software defects, and identify risky code changes. However, software development teams are unaware of SDP and do not have easy access to relevant models and techniques. The major reason for this problem seems to be the fragmentation of SDP research and SDP practice. To unify SDP research and practice this article introduces a cloud-based, global, unified AI framework for SDP called DePaaS-Defects Prediction as a Service. The article describes the usage context, use cases and detailed architecture of DePaaS and presents the first response of the industry practitioners to DePaaS. In a first of its kind survey, the article captures practitioner's belief into SDP and ability of DePaaS to solve some of the known challenges of the field of software defect prediction. This article also provides a novel process for SDP, detailed description of the structure and behaviour of DePaaS architecture components, six best SDP models offered by DePaaS, a description of algorithms that recommend SDP models, feature sets and tunable parameters, and a rich set of challenges to build, use and sustain DePaaS. With the contributions of this article, SDP research and practice could be unified enabling building and using more pragmatic defect prediction models leading to increase in the efficiency of software testing.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a core feature of today's real-world applications, making it a trending topic within the software engineering (SE) community. The rise in the availability of AI techniques encompasses the capability to make rapid, automated, impactful decisions and predictions, leading to the adoption of AI techniques in SE. With industry revolution 4.0, the role of software engineering has become critical for developing productive, efficient, and quality software. Thus, there is a major need for AI techniques to be applied to enhance and improve the critical activities within the software engineering phases. Software is developed through intelligent software engineering phases. This paper concerns a systematic mapping study that aimed to characterize the publication landscape of AI techniques in software engineering. Gaps are identified and discussed by mapping these AI techniques against the SE phases to which they contributed. Many systematic mapping review papers have been produced only for a specific AI technique or a specific SE phase or activity. Hence, to our best of knowledge within the last decade, there is no systematic mapping review that has fully explored the overall trends in AI techniques and their application to all SE phases.

AB Context: Artificial intelligence (AI) has made its way into everyday activities, particularly through new techniques such as machine learning (ML). These techniques are implementable with little domain knowledge. This, combined with the difficulty of testing AI systems with traditional methods, has made system trustworthiness a pressing issue.
   Objective: This paper studies the methods used to validate practical AI systems reported in the literature. Our goal is to classify and describe the methods that are used in realistic settings to ensure the dependability of AI systems.
   Method: A systematic literature review resulted in 90 papers. Systems presented in the papers were analysed based on their domain, task, complexity, and applied validation methods.
   Results: The validation methods were synthesized into a taxonomy consisting of trial, simulation, model-centred validation, and expert opinion. Failure monitors, safety channels, redundancy, voting, and input and output restrictions are methods used to continuously validate the systems after deployment.
   Conclusions: Our results clarify existing strategies applied to validation. They form a basis for the synthesization, assessment, and refinement of AI system validation in research and guidelines for validating individual systems in practice. While various validation strategies have all been relatively widely applied, only few studies report on continuous validation. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Context: Advancements in machine learning (ML) lead to a shift from the traditional view of software development, where algorithms are hard-coded by humans, to ML systems materialized through learning from data. Therefore, we need to revisit our ways of developing software systems and consider the particularities required by these new types of systems.
   Objective: The purpose of this study is to systematically identify, analyze, summarize, and synthesize the current state of software engineering (SE) research for engineering ML systems.
   Method: I performed a systematic literature review (SLR). I systematically selected a pool of 141 studies from SE venues and then conducted a quantitative and qualitative analysis using the data extracted from these studies.
   Results: The non-deterministic nature of ML systems complicates all SE aspects of engineering ML systems. Despite increasing interest from 2018 onwards, the results reveal that none of the SE aspects have a mature set of tools and techniques. Testing is by far the most popular area among researchers. Even for testing ML systems, engineers have only some tool prototypes and solution proposals with weak experimental proof. Many of the challenges of ML systems engineering were identified through surveys and interviews. Researchers should conduct experiments and case studies, ideally in industrial environments, to further understand these challenges and propose solutions.
   Conclusion: The results may benefit (1) practitioners in foreseeing the challenges of ML systems engineering; (2) researchers and academicians in identifying potential research questions; and (3) educators in designing or updating SE courses to cover ML systems engineering.

AB The main challenges are discussed together with the lessons learned from past and ongoing research along the development cycle of machine learning systems. This will be done by taking into account intrinsic conditions of nowadays deep learning models, data and software quality issues and human-centered artificial intelligence (AI) postulates, including confidentiality and ethical aspects. The analysis outlines a fundamental theory-practice gap which superimposes the challenges of AI system engineering at the level of data quality assurance, model building, software engineering and deployment. The aim of this paper is to pinpoint research topics to explore approaches to address these challenges.

AB DevOps is an emerging paradigm that reduces the barriers between developers and operations teams to offer continuous fast delivery and enable quick responses to changing requirements within the software life cycle. A significant volume of activity has been carried out in recent years with the aim of coupling DevOps stages with tools and methods to improve the quality of the produced software and the underpinning delivery methodology. While the research community has produced a sustained effort by conducting numerous studies and innovative development tools to support quality analyses within DevOps, there is still a limited cohesion between the research themes in this domain and a shortage of surveys that holistically examine quality engineering work within DevOps. In this paper, we address the gap by comprehensively surveying existing efforts in this area, categorizing them according to the stage of the DevOps lifecycle to which they primarily contribute. The survey holistically spans across all the DevOps stages, identify research efforts to improve architectural design, modeling and infrastructure-as-code, continuous-integration/continuous-delivery (CI/CD), testing and verification, and runtime management. Our analysis also outlines possible directions for future work in quality-aware DevOps, looking in particular at AI for DevOps and DevOps for AI software.

AB AI solutions seem to appear in any and all application domains. As AI becomes more pervasive, the importance of quality assurance increases. Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what artificial intelligence means and interpretations range from simple statistical analysis to sentient humanoid robots. On top of that, quality is a notoriously hard concept to pinpoint. What does this mean for AI quality? In this paper, we share our working definition and a pragmatic approach to address the corresponding quality assurance with a focus on testing. Finally, we present our ongoing work on establishing the AIQ Meta-Testbed.

AB The number and importance of AI-based systems in all domains is growing. With the pervasive use and the dependence on AI-based systems, the quality of these systems becomes essential for their practical usage. However, quality assurance for AI-based systems is an emerging area that has not been well explored and requires collaboration between the SE and AI research communities. This paper discusses terminology and challenges on quality assurance for AI-based systems to set a baseline for that purpose. Therefore, we define basic concepts and characterize AI-based systems along the three dimensions of artifact type, process, and quality characteristics. Furthermore, we elaborate on the key challenges of (1) understandability and interpretability of AI models, (2) lack of specifications and defined requirements, (3) need for validation data and test input generation, (4) defining expected outcomes as test oracles, (5) accuracy and correctness measures, (6) non-functional properties of AI-based systems, (7) self-adaptive and self-learning characteristics, and (8) dynamic and frequently changing environments.

AB The automation of functional testing in software has allowed developers to continuously check for negative impacts on functionality throughout the iterative phases of development. This is not the case for User eXperience (UX), which has hitherto relied almost exclusively on testing with real users. User testing is a slow endeavour that can become a bottleneck for development of interactive systems. To address this problem, we here propose an agent based approach for automatic UX testing. We develop agents with basic problem solving skills and a core affect model, allowing us to model an artificial affective state as they traverse different levels of a game. Although this research is still at a primordial state, we believe the results here presented make a strong case for the use of intelligent agents endowed with affective computing models for automating UX testing.

DE RESTful web API; web services testing; artificial neural network
AB Automated test case generation for RESTful web APIs is a thriving research topic due to their key role in software integration. Most approaches in this domain follow a black-box approach, where test cases are randomly derived from the API specification. These techniques show promising results, but they neglect constraints among input parameters (so-called interparameter dependencies), as these cannot be formally described in current API specification languages. As a result, when testing real-world services, most random test cases tend to be invalid since they violate some of the inter-parameter dependencies of the service, making human intervention indispensable. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach for automatically predicting the validity of an API request (i.e., test input) before calling the actual API. The model is trained with the API requests and responses collected during the generation and execution of previous test cases. Preliminary results with five real-world RESTful APIs and 16K automatically generated test cases show that test inputs validity can be predicted with an accuracy ranging from 86% to 100% in APIs like Yelp, GitHub, and YouTube. These are encouraging results that show the potential of artificial intelligence to improve current test case generation techniques.

AB Analytical quality assurance, especially testing, is an integral part of software-intensive system development. With the increased usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) as part of such systems, this becomes more difficult as well-understood software testing approaches cannot be applied directly to the AI-enabled parts of the system. The required adaptation of classical testing approaches and the development of new concepts for AI would benefit from a deeper understanding and exchange between AI and software engineering experts. We see the different terminologies used in the two communities as a major obstacle on this way. As we consider a mutual understanding of the testing terminology a key, this paper contributes a mapping between the most important concepts from classical software testing and AI testing. In the mapping, we highlight differences in the relevance and naming of the mapped concepts.

AB Test and evaluation is a necessary process for ensuring that engineered systems perform as intended under a variety of conditions, both expected and unexpected. In this work, we consider the unique challenges of developing a unifying test and evaluation framework for complex ensembles of cyber-physical systems with embedded artificial intelligence. We propose a framework that incorporates test and evaluation throughout not only the development life cycle, but continues into operation as the system learns and adapts in a noisy, changing, and contended environment. The framework accounts for the challenges of testing the integration of diverse systems at various hierarchical scales of composition while respecting that testing time and resources are limited. A generic use case is provided for illustrative purposes. Research directions emerging as a result of exploring the use case via the framework are suggested.

AB Test automation is common in software development; often one tests repeatedly to identify regressions. If the amount of test cases is large, one may select a subset and only use the most important test cases. The regression test selection (RTS) could be automated and enhanced with Artificial Intelligence (AI-RTS). This however could introduce ethical challenges. While such challenges in AI are in general well studied, there is a gap with respect to ethical AI-RTS. By exploring the literature and learning from our experiences of developing an industry AI-RTS tool, we contribute to the literature by identifying three challenges (assigning responsibility, bias in decision-making and lack of participation) and three approaches (explicability, supervision and diversity). Additionally, we provide a checklist for ethical AI-RTS to help guide the decision-making of the stakeholders involved in the process.

ID CLUSTER-ANALYSIS
AB Unsupervised machine learning is the training of an artificial intelligence system using information that is neither classified nor labeled, with a view to modeling the underlying structure or distribution in a dataset. Since unsupervised machine learning systems are widely used in many real-world applications, assessing the appropriateness of these systems and validating their implementations with respect to individual users' requirements and specific application scenarios/contexts are indisputably two important tasks. Such assessments and validation tasks, however, are fairly challenging due to the absence of a priori knowledge of the data. In view of this challenge, in this article, we develop a METamorphic Testing approach to assessing and validating unsupervised machine LEarning systems, abbreviated as mettle. Our approach provides a new way to unveil the (possibly latent) characteristics of various machine learning systems, by explicitly considering the specific expectations and requirements of these systems from individual users' perspectives. To support mettle, we have further formulated 11 generic metamorphic relations (MRs), covering users' generally expected characteristics that should be possessed by machine learning systems. We have performed an experiment and a user evaluation study to evaluate the viability and effectiveness of mettle. Our experiment and user evaluation study have shown that, guided by user-defined MR-based adequacy criteria, end users are able to assess, validate, and select appropriate clustering systems in accordance with their own specific needs. Our investigation has also yielded insightful understanding and interpretation of the behavior of the machine learning systems from an end-user software engineering's perspective, rather than a designer's or implementor's perspective, who normally adopts a theoretical approach.

AB Software Engineering is a discipline that encompasses processes associated with the development of interactive systems. The perceived quality of an interactive system is heavily influenced by the user interface design, which may result in many challenges. One such challenge is design-level requirements analysis. The success of the software system is mostly dependent on how well users' requirements have been understood and translated into appropriate functionalities. During the interactive system design process, it is common to find recurring problems in human-computer interactions, for which reusing solutions is highly feasible. Interaction design patterns seek to support designers in decision making during the design of interactive systems. Due to the design task tends to be subjective and prone to errors. This work aims at presenting and evaluating an interaction design patterns recommendation model based on design-level requirements classification, through the application of supervised machine learning algorithms. To compare the performance of four classification algorithms, a study was carried out, in which the linear support vector machine was the most suitable to this problem. The results of this work can be used for implementing frameworks that can better support designers' decision making when designing user interfaces.

AB Detecting the dependency between integration test cases plays a vital role in the area of software test optimization. Classifying test cases into two main classes - dependent and independent - can be employed for several test optimization purposes such as parallel test execution, test automation, test case selection and prioritization, and test suite reduction. This task can be seen as an imbalanced classification problem due to the test cases' distribution. Often the number of dependent and independent test cases is uneven, which is related to the testing level, testing environment and complexity of the system under test. In this study, we propose a novel methodology that consists of two main steps. Firstly, by using natural language processing we analyze the test cases' specifications and turn them into a numeric vector. Secondly, by using the obtained data vectors, we classify each test case into a dependent or an independent class. We carry out a supervised learning approach using different methods for handling imbalanced datasets. The feasibility and possible generalization of the proposed methodology is evaluated in two industrial projects at Bombardier Transportation, Sweden, which indicates promising results.

AB Software quality plays an important role in the software lifecycle. Traditional software defect prediction approaches mainly focused on using hand-crafted features to detect defects. However, like human languages, programming languages contain rich semantic and structural information, and the cause of defective code is closely related to its context. Failing to catch this significant information, the performance of traditional approaches is far from satisfactory. In this study, the authors leveraged a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to automatically learn the semantic and contextual features from the source code. Specifically, they first extract the program's Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), which is made up of AST nodes, and then evaluate what and how much information they can preserve for several node types. They traverse the AST of each file and fed them into the LSTM network to automatically the semantic and contextual features of the program, which is then used to determine whether the file is defective. Experimental results on several opensource projects showed that the proposed LSTM method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Artificial intelligence is one of the key technologies for progression to the fourth industrial revolution. This technology also has a significant impact on software professionals who are continuously striving to achieve high-quality software development by fixing various types of software bugs. During the software development and maintenance stages, software bugs are the major factor that can affect the cost and time of software delivery. To efficiently fix a software bug, open bug repositories are used for identifying bug reports and for classifying and prioritizing the reports for assignment to the most appropriate software developers based on their level of interest and expertise. Owing to a lack of resources such as time and manpower, this bug report triage process is extremely important in software development. To improve the bug report triage performance, numerous studies have focused on a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) using the k-nearest neighbors or a support vector machine. Although the existing approaches have improved the accuracy of a bug triage, they often cause conflicts between the combined techniques and generate incorrect triage results. In this study, we propose a method for improving the bug report triage performance using multiple LDA-based topic sets by improving the LDA. The proposed method improves the existing topic sets of the LDA by building two adjunct topic sets. In our experiment, we collected bug reports from a popular bug tracking system, Bugzilla, as well as Android bug reports, to evaluate the proposed method and demonstrate the achievement of the following two goals: increase the bug report triage accuracy, and satisfy the compatibility with other state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Complexity of web systems lead to development processes always more tough to test. Testing phases are crucial in software and system engineering and are known to be very costly. While automated testing methods appear to take over the role of the human testers, the issues of reliability and the capability of the testing method still need to be solved. In our paper, we focus on the automation of functional tests of websites. A single web page may contain a huge set of important functionalities leading to the execution of critical web service operations. Besides, testing all of these functionalities implemented in a web page service is highly complex. Two current popular research areas for automation web-based testing are Codeless Functional Test Automation and Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI) in test automation. We therefore define and implement a framework to figure out how to automate the web service product under test, the machine can detect or predict the change and adapt those changes to suitable generic test cases. In our work, we examine on Selenium and the benefits of using machine learning in automated web application testing.

AB Artificially intelligent (AI) game software incorporates different algorithms to generate intelligent human-like responses to the users playing them. Testing AI game software poses great difficulty because of the complex possibilities that can result at a given point and analysis of said possibilities is a tedious task. Also during software development there are resource constraints due to which testing targets specific parts of the software. An AI game of Chess takes into consideration a large amount of possible outcomes at any given point before deciding a move. Therefore, testing it in its entirety is impractical. In this paper we propose a metamorphic testing approach for testing an AI Chess game i.e. a Chess engine's algorithm of determining and pruning out possible outcomes and ultimately deciding on a final outcome. For validating our approach, we have done error seeding on an open source Chess engine and tested it through our approach. The results for our proposed approach for testing an AI Chess game through metamorphic relations show that it is successful in revealing 71% of the total seeded faults. On comparison of our proposed approach with the existing technique of testing Chess engine i.e., perft function, we have come across situations in which our proposed approach reveals errors overlooked by the existing technique. In the future we aim to extend our approach towards other AI game software.

AB Software testing is an expanding area which presents an increasing complexity. Indeed, on one hand, there is the development of technologies such as Software Testing as a Service (TaaS), and on the other hand, there is a growing number of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based softwares. Hence, this work is about the development of an ontological framework for AI-softwares' Testing (AI-T), which domain covers both software testing and explainable artificial intelligence; the goal being to produce an ontology which guides the testing of AI softwares, in an effective and interoperable way. For this purpose, AI-T ontology includes temporal interval logic modelling of the software testing process as well as ethical principle formalization and has been built using the Enterprise Ontology (EO) methodology. Our resulting AI-T ontology proposes both conceptual and implementation models and contains 708 terms and 706 axioms.

AB This paper presents an automated tool called Morphy for datamorphic testing. It classifies software test artefacts into test entities and test morphisms, which are mappings on testing entities. In addition to datamorphisms, metamorphisms and seed test case makers, Morphy also employs a set of other test morphisms including test case metrics and filters, test set metrics and filters, test result analysers and test executers to realise test automation. In particular, basic testing activities can be automated by invoking test morphisms. Test strategies can be realised as complex combinations of test morphisms. Test processes can be automated by recording, editing and playing test scripts that invoke test morphisms and strategies. This paper proposes a set of test strategies that combine datamorphisms to generate test sets that adequately cover various types of mutant test cases. These strategies are formally defined. Their implementation algorithms are provided. The correctness of the algorithms are proved. The paper also illustrates their uses for testing both traditional software and AI applications with three case studies.

AB In recent years, data published and shared with third parties to develop artificial intelligence (AI) tools and services has significantly increased. When there are regulatory or internal requirements regarding privacy of data, anonymization techniques are used to maintain privacy by transforming the data. The side-effect is that the anonymization may lead to useless data to train and test the AI because it is highly dependent on the quality of the data. To overcome this problem, we propose a test-driven anonymization approach for artificial intelligence tools. The approach tests different anonymization efforts to achieve a trade-off in terms of privacy (non-functional quality) and functional suitability of the artificial intelligence technique (functional quality). The approach has been validated by means of two real-life datasets in the domains of healthcare and health insurance. Each of these datasets is anonymized with several privacy protections and then used to train classification AIs. The results show how we can anonymize the data to achieve an adequate functional suitability in the AI context while maintaining the privacy of the anonymized data as high as possible.

ID GENERATION
AB Software testing is a vital and complex part of the software development life cycle. Optimization of software testing is still a major challenge, as prioritization of test cases remains unsatisfactory in terms of Average Percentage of Faults Detected (APFD) and time execution performance. This is attributed to a large search space to find an optimal ordering of test cases. In this paper, we have proposed an approach to prioritize test cases optimally using Firefly Algorithm. To optimize the ordering of test cases, we applied Firefly Algorithm with fitness function defined using a similarity distance model. Experiments were carried on three benchmark programs with test suites extracted from Software-artifact Infrastructure Repository (SIR). Our Test Case Prioritization (TCP) technique using Firefly Algorithm with similarity distance model demonstrated better if not equal in terms of APFD and time execution performance compared to existing works. Overall APFD results indicate that Firefly Algorithm is a promising competitor in TCP applications.

AB Software testing is an important but expensive activity of software development life cycle, as it accounts for more than 52% of entire development cost. Testing requires the execution of all possible test cases in order to find the defects in the software. Therefore, different test suite optimization approaches like the genetic algorithm and the greedy algorithm, etc., are widely used to select the representative test suite without compromising the effectiveness. Test suite optimization is frequently researched to enhance its competences but there is no study published until now that analyzes the latest developments from 2016 to 2019. Hence, in this article, we systematically examine the state-of-the-art optimizations' approaches, tools, and supporting platforms. Principally, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to inspect and examine 58 selected studies that are published during 2016-2019. Subsequently, the selected researches are grouped into five main categories, i.e., greedy algorithm (seven studies), meta-heuristic (28 studies), hybrid (six studies), clustering (five studies), and general (12 studies). Finally, 32 leading tools have been presented, i.e., existing tools (25 tools) and proposed/developed tools (seven tools) along 14 platform supports. Furthermore, it is noted that several approaches aim at solving the single-objective optimization problem. Therefore, researchers should focus on dealing with the multi-objective problem, as multi-objective versions outperform the single-objective ones. Moreover, less attention has been given to clustering-based techniques. Thus, we recommend exploring the machine learning and artificial intelligence-based optimization approaches in the future. A broad exploration of tools and techniques, in this article, will help researchers, practitioners, and developers to opt for adequate techniques, tools, or platforms as per requirements.

AB Security breaches due to attacks by malicious software (malware) continue to escalate posing a major security concern in this digital age. With many computer users, corporations, and governments affected due to an exponential growth in malware attacks, malware detection continues to be a hot research topic. Current malware detection solutions that adopt the static and dynamic analysis of malware signatures and behavior patterns are time consuming and have proven to be ineffective in identifying unknown malwares in real-time. Recent malwares use polymorphic, metamorphic, and other evasive techniques to change the malware behaviors quickly and to generate a large number of new malwares. Such new malwares are predominantly variants of existing malwares, and machine learning algorithms (MLAs) are being employed recently to conduct an effective malware analysis. However, such approaches are time consuming as they require extensive feature engineering, feature learning, and feature representation. By using the advanced MLAs such as deep learning, the feature engineering phase can be completely avoided. Recently reported research studies in this direction show the performance of their algorithms with a biased training data, which limits their practical use in real-time situations. There is a compelling need to mitigate bias and evaluate these methods independently in order to arrive at a new enhanced method for effective zero-day malware detection. To fill the gap in the literature, this paper, first, evaluates the classical MLAs and deep learning architectures for malware detection, classification, and categorization using different public and private datasets. Second, we remove all the dataset bias removed in the experimental analysis by having different splits of the public and private datasets to train and test the model in a disjoint way using different timescales. Third, our major contribution is in proposing a novel image processing technique with optimal parameters for MLAs and deep learning architectures to arrive at an effective zero-day malware detection model. A comprehensive comparative study of our model demonstrates that our proposed deep learning architectures outperform classical MLAs. Our novelty in combining visualization and deep learning architectures for static, dynamic, and image processing-based hybrid approach applied in a big data environment is the first of its kind toward achieving robust intelligent zero-day malware detection. Overall, this paper paves way for an effective visual detection of malware using a scalable and hybrid deep learning framework for real-time deployments.

AB Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) has gained considerable popularity for the development of distributed enterprise-wide applications within the software industry. The SOA paradigm promotes the reusability and integrability of software in heterogeneous environments by means of open standards. Most software companies capitalize on SOA by discovering and composing services already accessible over the Internet, whereas other organizations need internal control of applications and develop new services with quality-attribute properties tailored to their particular environment. Therefore, based on architectural and business requirements, developers can elaborate different alternatives within a SOA framework to design their software applications. Each of these alternatives will imply trade-offs among quality attributes, such as performance, dependability and availability, among others. In this context, Artificial Intelligence (AI) can assist developers in dealing with service-oriented design with the positive impact on scalability and management of generic quality attributes. In this paper, we offer a detailed; conceptualized and synthesized analysis of AI research works that have aimed at discovering, composing, or developing services. We also identify open research issues and challenges in the aforementioned research areas. The results of the characterization of 69 contemporary approaches and potential research directions for the areas are also shown. It is concluded that AI has aimed at exploiting the semantic resources and achieving quality -attribute properties so as to produce flexible and adaptive-to-change service discovery, composition, and development (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
