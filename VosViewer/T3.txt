AB Ambiguity in software requirements is a significant challenge as it often leads to misunderstandings, implementation errors, and costly project delays. This research proposes a hybrid framework that combines rule-based techniques with machine learning to identify ambiguity in software requirements with precision and efficiency. The framework begins with a rule-based model that systematically detects ambiguities using a carefully prepared list of ambiguous phrases. The analysis utilizes a dataset of 1,553 software requirements drawn from diverse project domains. To capture more intricate ambiguities that traditional rule-based systems might miss, the framework integrates TF-IDF vectorization and a Random Forest classifier, enhancing the precision and coverage of classification. In addition, clustering analysis identifies patterns to provide deeper insights into ambiguous requirements, while sentiment analysis explores the relationship between ambiguity and the emotional tone of requirements. Together, these analyses offer a broader understanding of ambiguity trends and stakeholder perceptions. The framework's performance is validated using standard evaluation metrics, achieving an accuracy of 97%, precision of 97%, recall of 89%, and an F1-score of 92%, significantly surpassing traditional rule-based methodologies. This research advances automatic ambiguity detection by delivering a flexible and interpretable solution. The proposed approach enhances the clarity and quality of software requirements, strengthening requirements engineering practices and supporting more effective software development.

TI ChatGPT Code Detection: Techniques for Uncovering the Source of Code

DE AI; machine learning; code detection; ChatGPT; large language models
AB In recent times, large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in generating computer code, blurring the lines between code created by humans and code produced by artificial intelligence (AI). As these technologies evolve rapidly, it is crucial to explore how they influence code generation, especially given the risk of misuse in areas such as higher education. The present paper explores this issue by using advanced classification techniques to differentiate between code written by humans and code generated by ChatGPT, a type of LLM. We employ a new approach that combines powerful embedding features (black-box) with supervised learning algorithms including Deep Neural Networks, Random Forests, and Extreme Gradient Boosting to achieve this differentiation with an impressive accuracy of 98%. For the successful combinations, we also examine their model calibration, showing that some of the models are extremely well calibrated. Additionally, we present white-box features and an interpretable Bayes classifier to elucidate critical differences between the code sources, enhancing the explainability and transparency of our approach. Both approaches work well, but provide at most 85-88% accuracy. Tests on a small sample of untrained humans suggest that humans do not solve the task much better than random guessing. This study is crucial in understanding and mitigating the potential risks associated with using AI in code generation, particularly in the context of higher education, software development, and competitive programming.

AB Data clumps, groups of variables that repeatedly appear together across different parts of a software system, are indicative of poor code structure and can lead to potential issues such as maintenance challenges, testing complexity, and scalability concerns, among others. Addressing this, our study introduces an innovative AI-driven pipeline specifically designed for the refactoring of data clumps in software repositories. This pipeline leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM), such as ChatGPT, to automate the detection and resolution of data clumps, thereby enhancing code quality and maintainability. In developing this pipeline, we have taken into consideration the new European Union (EU)-Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act, ensuring that our pipeline complies with the latest regulatory requirements and ethical standards for use of AI in software development by outsourcing decisions to a human in the loop. Preliminary experiments utilizing ChatGPT were conducted to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. These tests demonstrate promising results in identifying and refactoring data clumps, but also the challenges using LLMs.

AB Machine learning is part of the daily life of people and companies worldwide. Unfortunately, bias in machine learning algorithms risks unfairly influencing the decision-making process and reiterating possible discrimination. While the interest of the software engineering community in software fairness is rapidly increasing, there is still a lack of understanding of various aspects connected to fair machine learning engineering, i.e., the software engineering process involved in developing fairness-critical machine learning systems. Questions connected to the practitioners' awareness and maturity about fairness, the skills required to deal with the matter, and the best development phase(s) where fairness should be faced more are just some examples of the knowledge gaps currently open. In this paper, we provide insights into how fairness is perceived and managed in practice, to shed light on the instruments and approaches that practitioners might employ to properly handle fairness. We conducted a survey with 117 professionals who shared their knowledge and experience highlighting the relevance of fairness in practice, and the skills and tools required to handle it. The key results of our study show that fairness is still considered a second-class quality aspect in the development of artificial intelligence systems. The building of specific methods and development environments, other than automated validation tools, might help developers to treat fairness throughout the software lifecycle and revert this trend.

DE OpenAI ChatGPT; GitHub Copilot; code quality
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly popular in software development to automate tasks and improve efficiency. AI has the potential to help while developing or maintaining software, in the sense that it can produce solutions out of a textual requirement specification, and understand code to provide suggestion on how a new requirement could be implemented. In this paper, we focus on the first scenario. Two AI-powered tools that have the potential to revolutionize the way software is developed are OpenAI's ChatGPT and GitHub's Copilot. In this paper, we used LeetCode, a popular platform for technical interview preparation and personal upskilling (self-learning), to evaluate the effectiveness of ChatGPT and Copilot on a set of coding problems, along with ChatGPT's ability to correct itself when provided with feedback. The analysis of the effectiveness can lead to various conclusions, such as on if these solutions are ready to take over coding roles, and to what extent several parameters (difficulty and quality requirements) influence this result. Solutions have been generated for 60 problems using ChatGPT and Copilot, for the Python programming language. We investigated the performance of the models, the recurrent kinds of errors, and the resulting code quality. The evaluation revealed that ChatGPT and Copilot can be effective tools for generating code solutions for easy problems while both models are prone to syntax and semantic errors. Small improvements are observed for ode quality metrics across iterations, although the improvement pattern is not consistently monotonic, questioning ChatGPT's awareness of the quality of its own solutions. Nevertheless, the improvement that was found along iterations, highlights the potential of AI and humans, acting as partners, in providing the optimal combination. The two models demonstrate a limited capacity for understanding context. Although AI-powered coding tools driven by large language models have the potential to assist developers in their coding tasks, they should be used with caution and in conjunction with human coding expertise. Developer intervention is necessary not only to debug errors but also to ensure high-quality and optimized code.

AB Large Language Models (LLMs) have grown in popularity in recent years and are now employed in a variety of software engineering domains thanks to their Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities, which include source code generation, understanding, and documentation. Selecting the appropriate model for source code generation presents a problem to developers as more and more powerful LLMs become available. While some studies have evaluated Copilot or ChatGPT, there is a lack of research on how developers can choose from available LLMs, which is a key factor in the growing set of available models and services. It is crucial to know if a model is capable of generating useful source code that meets the quality requirements and if the developers will be able to use the generated code. Regarding these factors, one has to decide which model to utilize during everyday tasks. This paper shows a methodology to compare such models by demonstrating an actual comparison of two models. Subsequently, we investigated the functional and non-functional qualities of the code synthesized by the models on a program synthesis benchmark containing 25 tasks. On average, the functional testing shows that ChatGPT generated 17 perfect solutions, while Copilot could only solve 13. The non-functional analysis reflected that both models generated good quality code, however, both have characteristic code smells. Our evaluation shows that ChatGPT performs better using this methodology, which is supported by human reviewers who evaluated the generated code by hand.

AB Scaled agile development approaches are now used widely in modern software engineering, allowing businesses to improve teamwork, productivity, and product quality. The incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) into scaled agile development methods (SADMs) has emerged as a potential strategy in response to the ongoing demand for simplified procedures and the increasing complexity of software projects. This paper explores the intersection of AI-driven assistants within the context of the scaled agile framework (SAFe) for large-scale software development, as it stands out as the most widely adopted framework. Our paper pursues three principal objectives: (1) an evaluation of the challenges and impediments encountered by organizations during the implementation of SADMs, (2) an assessment of the potential advantages stemming from the incorporation of AI in large-scale contexts, and (3) the compilation of aspects of SADMs that AI-driven assistants enhance. Through a comprehensive systematic literature review, we identified and described 18 distinct challenges that organizations confront. In the course of our research, we pinpointed seven benefits and five challenges associated with the implementation of AI in SADMs. These findings were systematically categorized based on their occurrence either within the development phase or the phases encompassing planning and control. Furthermore, we compiled a list of 15 different AI-driven assistants and tools, subjecting them to a more detailed examination, and employing them to address the challenges we uncovered during our research. One of the key takeaways from this paper is the exceptional versatility and effectiveness of AI-driven assistants, demonstrating their capability to tackle a broader spectrum of problems. In conclusion, this paper not only sheds light on the transformative potential of AI, but also provides invaluable insights for organizations aiming to enhance their agility and management capabilities.

AB In a world where Artificial Intelligence (AI) is pervasive, humans may feel threatened or at risk by giving up control to machines. In this context, ethicality becomes a major concern to prevent AI systems from being biased, making mistakes, or going rogue. Requirements Engineering (RE) is the research area that can exert a great impact in the development of ethical systems by design. However, proposing concepts, tools and techniques that support the incorporation of ethicality into the software development processes as explicit requirements remains a great challenge in the RE field. In this paper, we rely on Ontology-based Requirements Engineering (ObRE) as a method to elicit and analyze ethicality requirements ('Ethicality requirements' is adopted as a name for the class of requirements studied in this paper by analogy to other quality requirements studied in software engineering, such as usability, reliability, and portability, etc. The use of this term (as opposed to 'ethical requirements') highlights that they represent requirements for ethical systems, analogous to how 'trustworthiness requirements' represent requirements for trustworthy systems. To put simply: the predicates 'ethical' or 'trustworthy' are not meant to be predicated over the requirements themselves). ObRE applies ontological analysis to ontologically unpack terms and notions that are referred to in requirements elicitation. Moreover, this method instantiates the adopted ontology and uses it to guide the requirements analysis activity. In a previous paper, we presented a solution concerning two ethical principles, namely Beneficence and Non-maleficence. The present paper extends the previous work by targeting two other important ethicality principles, those of Explicability and Autonomy. For each of these new principles, we do ontological unpacking of the relevant concepts, and we present requirements elicitation and analysis guidelines, as well as examples in the context of a driverless car case. Furthermore, we validate our approach by analysing the requirements elicitation made for the driverless car case in contrast with a similar case, and by assessing our method's coverage w.r.t European Union guidelines for Trustworthy AI.

AB Context: Artificial intelligence (AI) components used in building software solutions have substantially increased in recent years. However, many of these solutions focus on technical aspects and ignore critical human-centered aspects.Objective: Including human-centered aspects during requirements engineering (RE) when building AI-based software can help achieve more responsible, unbiased, and inclusive AI-based software solutions.Method: In this paper, we present a new framework developed based on human-centered AI guidelines and a user survey to aid in collecting requirements for human-centered AI-based software. We provide a catalog to elicit these requirements and a conceptual model to present them visually.Results: The framework is applied to a case study to elicit and model requirements for enhancing the quality of 360 degrees videos intended for virtual reality (VR) users.Conclusion: We found that our proposed approach helped the project team fully understand the human-centered needs of the project to deliver. Furthermore, the framework helped to understand what requirements need to be captured at the initial stages against later stages in the engineering process of AI-based software.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB Context: Engineering Artificial Intelligence (AI) software is a relatively new area with many challenges, unknowns, and limited proven best practices. Big companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Apple have provided a suite of recent guidelines to assist engineering teams in building human-centered AI systems.Objective: The practices currently adopted by practitioners for developing such systems, especially during Requirements Engineering (RE), are little studied and reported to date. Method: This paper presents the results of a survey conducted to understand current industry practices in RE for AI (RE4AI) and to determine which key human-centered AI guidelines should be followed. Our survey is based on mapping existing industrial guidelines, best practices, and efforts in the literature.Results: We surveyed 29 professionals and found most participants agreed that all the human-centered aspects we mapped should be addressed in RE. Further, we found that most participants were using UML or Microsoft Office to present requirements.Conclusion: We identify that most of the tools currently used are not equipped to manage AI-based software, and the use of UML and Office may pose issues with the quality of requirements captured for AI. Also, all human-centered practices mapped from the guidelines should be included in RE. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Software requirements show what the customer desires his software to do. They are the first stepping stone towards a successful software development project. With the increasing complexity of the software due to its size and feature base, it is vital to prioritize the requirements for efficient utilization of development resources. To achieve this, industrial organizations are devising new strategies and improved solutions even with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) tool set. Existing requirements prioritization techniques are human-intensive and suffer from several limitations like overlapping outcomes, scalability problems, time consumption, inaccuracy, and so on. Some of the problems can be solved by including artificial intelligence algorithms and strategies. Several AI-based requirements prioritization techniques have been proposed by applying Genetic Algorithms, Fuzzy Logic, Ant Colony Optimization, and Machine Learning. Literature witnesses some good review studies and surveys on conventional prioritization techniques but there exists none for AI-based techniques that identify not only their strengths but also their weaknesses, advantages of machine learning techniques over other AI-based requirements prioritization techniques, and limitations of applying AI-based techniques in requirements prioritization. This study presents a systematic literature review (SLR) of AI-based requirements prioritization approaches covering 46 papers published from 2000 to 2021. We have given this literature review a new dimension by conducting a parametric analysis of AI-based requirements prioritization techniques and we have identified these parameters after a thorough literature study. Some of the chosen parameters are generic (related to the prioritization process) and some are specific (related to AI techniques). This study has greatly helped us draw a clear line among AI-based techniques to show their domain of application to gain maximum advantage. Our findings will assist researchers, requirement analysts, and other stakeholders in making a wise decision to select the best requirements prioritization technique to gain optimal results.

AB The increasing integration of AI software into various aspects of our daily lives has amplified the importance of evaluating the quality of these intelligent systems. The rapid proliferation of AI-based software projects and the growing reliance on these systems underscore the urgency of examining their quality for practical applications in both industry and academia. This systematic literature review delves into the study of quality assessment metrics and methods for AI-based systems, pinpointing key attributes and properties of intelligent software projects that are crucial for determining their quality. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of this domain will enable researchers to devise novel methods and metrics for effectively and efficiently evaluating the quality of such systems. Despite its importance, this area of development is still relatively nascent and evolving. This paper presents a systematic review of the current state of the taxonomy of quality assessment for AI-based software. We analyzed 271 articles from six different sources that focused on the quality assessment of intelligent software systems. The primary objective of this work is to provide an overview of the field and consolidate knowledge, which will aid researchers in identifying additional areas for future research. Moreover, our findings reveal the necessity to establish remedial strategies and develop tools to automate the process of identifying appropriate actions in response to abnormal metric values.

AB The most significant invention made in recent years to serve various applications is software. Developing a faultless software system requires the soft-ware system design to be resilient. To make the software design more efficient, it is essential to assess the reusability of the components used. This paper proposes a software reusability prediction model named Flexible Random Fit (FRF) based on aging resilience for a Service Net (SN) software system. The reusability prediction model is developed based on a multilevel optimization technique based on software characteristics such as cohesion, coupling, and complexity. Metrics are obtained from the SN software system, which is then subjected to min-max normalization to avoid any saturation during the learning process. The feature extraction process is made more feasible by enriching the data quality via outlier detection. The reusability of the classes is estimated based on a tool called Soft Audit. Software reusability can be predicted more effectively based on the pro-posed FRF-ANN (Flexible Random Fit -Artificial Neural Network) algorithm. Performance evaluation shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms all the other techniques, thus ensuring the optimization of software reusability based on aging resilient. The model is then tested using constraint-based testing techniques to make sure that it is perfect at optimizing and making predictions.

AB The development of machine learning systems has to ensure their robustness and reliability. The authors introduce a framework that defines a principled process of machine learning system formation, from research to production, for various domains and data scenarios.
   The development and deployment of machine learning systems can be executed easily with modern tools, but the process is typically rushed and means-to-an-end. Lack of diligence can lead to technical debt, scope creep and misaligned objectives, model misuse and failures, and expensive consequences. Engineering systems, on the other hand, follow well-defined processes and testing standards to streamline development for high-quality, reliable results. The extreme is spacecraft systems, with mission critical measures and robustness throughout the process. Drawing on experience in both spacecraft engineering and machine learning (research through product across domain areas), we've developed a proven systems engineering approach for machine learning and artificial intelligence: the Machine Learning Technology Readiness Levels framework defines a principled process to ensure robust, reliable, and responsible systems while being streamlined for machine learning workflows, including key distinctions from traditional software engineering, and a lingua franca for people across teams and organizations to work collaboratively on machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies. Here we describe the framework and elucidate with use-cases from physics research to computer vision apps to medical diagnostics.

AB AI-based systems are software systems with functionalities enabled by at least one AI component (e.g., for image-, speech-recognition, and autonomous driving). AI-based systems are becoming pervasive in society due to advances in AI. However, there is limited synthesized knowledge on Software Engineering (SE) approaches for building, operating, and maintaining AI-based systems. To collect and analyze state-of-the-art knowledge about SE for AI-based systems, we conducted a systematic mapping study. We considered 248 studies published between January 2010 and March 2020. SE for AI-based systems is an emerging research area, where more than 2/3 of the studies have been published since 2018. The most studied properties of AI-based systems are dependability and safety. We identified multiple SE approaches for AI-based systems, which we classified according to the SWEBOK areas. Studies related to software testing and software quality are very prevalent, while areas like software maintenance seem neglected. Data-related issues are the most recurrent challenges. Our results are valuable for: researchers, to quickly understand the state-of-the-art and learn which topics need more research; practitioners, to learn about the approaches and challenges that SE entails for AI-based systems; and, educators, to bridge the gap among SE and AI in their curricula.

AB AI ethics principles and guidelines are typically high-level and do not provide concrete guidance on how to develop responsible AI systems. To address this shortcoming, we perform an empirical study involving interviews with 21 scientists and engineers to understand the practitioners' views on AI ethics principles and their implementation. Our major findings are: (1) the current practice is often a done-once-and-forget type of ethical risk assessment at a particular development step, which is not sufficient for highly uncertain and continual learning AI systems; (2) ethical requirements are either omitted or mostly stated as high-level objectives, and not specified explicitly in verifiable way as system outputs or outcomes; (3) although ethical requirements have the characteristics of cross-cutting quality and non-functional requirements amenable to architecture and design analysis, system-level architecture and design are under-explored; (4) there is a strong desire for continuously monitoring and validating AI systems post deployment for ethical requirements but current operation practices provide limited guidance. To address these findings, we suggest a preliminary list of patterns to provide operationalised guidance for developing responsible AI systems.

AB Context: Advancements in machine learning (ML) lead to a shift from the traditional view of software development, where algorithms are hard-coded by humans, to ML systems materialized through learning from data. Therefore, we need to revisit our ways of developing software systems and consider the particularities required by these new types of systems.
   Objective: The purpose of this study is to systematically identify, analyze, summarize, and synthesize the current state of software engineering (SE) research for engineering ML systems.
   Method: I performed a systematic literature review (SLR). I systematically selected a pool of 141 studies from SE venues and then conducted a quantitative and qualitative analysis using the data extracted from these studies.
   Results: The non-deterministic nature of ML systems complicates all SE aspects of engineering ML systems. Despite increasing interest from 2018 onwards, the results reveal that none of the SE aspects have a mature set of tools and techniques. Testing is by far the most popular area among researchers. Even for testing ML systems, engineers have only some tool prototypes and solution proposals with weak experimental proof. Many of the challenges of ML systems engineering were identified through surveys and interviews. Researchers should conduct experiments and case studies, ideally in industrial environments, to further understand these challenges and propose solutions.
   Conclusion: The results may benefit (1) practitioners in foreseeing the challenges of ML systems engineering; (2) researchers and academicians in identifying potential research questions; and (3) educators in designing or updating SE courses to cover ML systems engineering.

AB The main challenges are discussed together with the lessons learned from past and ongoing research along the development cycle of machine learning systems. This will be done by taking into account intrinsic conditions of nowadays deep learning models, data and software quality issues and human-centered artificial intelligence (AI) postulates, including confidentiality and ethical aspects. The analysis outlines a fundamental theory-practice gap which superimposes the challenges of AI system engineering at the level of data quality assurance, model building, software engineering and deployment. The aim of this paper is to pinpoint research topics to explore approaches to address these challenges.

AB DevOps is an emerging paradigm that reduces the barriers between developers and operations teams to offer continuous fast delivery and enable quick responses to changing requirements within the software life cycle. A significant volume of activity has been carried out in recent years with the aim of coupling DevOps stages with tools and methods to improve the quality of the produced software and the underpinning delivery methodology. While the research community has produced a sustained effort by conducting numerous studies and innovative development tools to support quality analyses within DevOps, there is still a limited cohesion between the research themes in this domain and a shortage of surveys that holistically examine quality engineering work within DevOps. In this paper, we address the gap by comprehensively surveying existing efforts in this area, categorizing them according to the stage of the DevOps lifecycle to which they primarily contribute. The survey holistically spans across all the DevOps stages, identify research efforts to improve architectural design, modeling and infrastructure-as-code, continuous-integration/continuous-delivery (CI/CD), testing and verification, and runtime management. Our analysis also outlines possible directions for future work in quality-aware DevOps, looking in particular at AI for DevOps and DevOps for AI software.

AB Analytical quality assurance, especially testing, is an integral part of software-intensive system development. With the increased usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) as part of such systems, this becomes more difficult as well-understood software testing approaches cannot be applied directly to the AI-enabled parts of the system. The required adaptation of classical testing approaches and the development of new concepts for AI would benefit from a deeper understanding and exchange between AI and software engineering experts. We see the different terminologies used in the two communities as a major obstacle on this way. As we consider a mutual understanding of the testing terminology a key, this paper contributes a mapping between the most important concepts from classical software testing and AI testing. In the mapping, we highlight differences in the relevance and naming of the mapped concepts.

AB With the development of artificial intelligence, machine learning has been applied in more and more domains. In order to improve the quality and efficiency of software, automatic program generation is becoming a research hotspot. In recent years, machine learning has also been gradually applied in automatic program generation. Decision trees, language models, and cyclic neural networks have been applied in code generation, code completion and code knowledge mining. The efficiency of software development has been improved to a certain extent using machine learning. Aimed at the automatic program generation, this paper analyzes and summarizes the models of machine learning, the modifications involved in the models and the application effects. The research direction is discussed from the aspects of programmer behavior and automatic program generation of machine learning.

ID SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS; IMPACT
AB Software Engineering is a discipline that encompasses processes associated with the development of interactive systems. The perceived quality of an interactive system is heavily influenced by the user interface design, which may result in many challenges. One such challenge is design-level requirements analysis. The success of the software system is mostly dependent on how well users' requirements have been understood and translated into appropriate functionalities. During the interactive system design process, it is common to find recurring problems in human-computer interactions, for which reusing solutions is highly feasible. Interaction design patterns seek to support designers in decision making during the design of interactive systems. Due to the design task tends to be subjective and prone to errors. This work aims at presenting and evaluating an interaction design patterns recommendation model based on design-level requirements classification, through the application of supervised machine learning algorithms. To compare the performance of four classification algorithms, a study was carried out, in which the linear support vector machine was the most suitable to this problem. The results of this work can be used for implementing frameworks that can better support designers' decision making when designing user interfaces.

AB Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) has gained considerable popularity for the development of distributed enterprise-wide applications within the software industry. The SOA paradigm promotes the reusability and integrability of software in heterogeneous environments by means of open standards. Most software companies capitalize on SOA by discovering and composing services already accessible over the Internet, whereas other organizations need internal control of applications and develop new services with quality-attribute properties tailored to their particular environment. Therefore, based on architectural and business requirements, developers can elaborate different alternatives within a SOA framework to design their software applications. Each of these alternatives will imply trade-offs among quality attributes, such as performance, dependability and availability, among others. In this context, Artificial Intelligence (AI) can assist developers in dealing with service-oriented design with the positive impact on scalability and management of generic quality attributes. In this paper, we offer a detailed; conceptualized and synthesized analysis of AI research works that have aimed at discovering, composing, or developing services. We also identify open research issues and challenges in the aforementioned research areas. The results of the characterization of 69 contemporary approaches and potential research directions for the areas are also shown. It is concluded that AI has aimed at exploiting the semantic resources and achieving quality -attribute properties so as to produce flexible and adaptive-to-change service discovery, composition, and development (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
